Converting Annotations Part 2
{"Body": " <p id=\"35\" style=\" \">In this tutorial, we will start building the proposed front-end on which our app is going to operate, with a <i>mobile-first</i> methodology to ensure that it looks consistent on all platforms and resolutions.\n</p>\n<p id=\"36\" style=\" \">In the <a href=\"/C/course/computer-science/django/annotations-tutorial-part-1-per-paragraph-commenting/10/\">previous tutorial</a>, we discussed what are annotations and how they differ from regular comments. We then discussed the various problems associated with identifying the content for which the annotation was created so that we may link the two later. In this tutorial, we will write the minimal markup of the article on which our annotations will be made. The style sheets are written in SASS which is then converted into CSS, with the emphasis being on application, rather than theory, and of course, over UX Design.\n</p>\n<p id=\"37\" style=\" \">OK. On to design! We start off from the front end design, trying to create the design as a user would experience it.\n</p>\n<p id=\"38\" style=\" \"><strong>What do we want?</strong> We want that little bubbles be available at the edges of the area where we want to allow such annotations. Because people usually read from left to right (there are a few right-to-left scripts though, we are not catering to them as of now), we\u2019ll put these bubbles on the right margin of our articles area.\n</p>\n<p id=\"39\" style=\" \">We\u2019ll refer to that area as <i>\u2018Commentable Container\u2019</i>. What I\u2019m trying to do here is start from the requirements, top down, and gradually move in, towards a full implementation.\n</p>\n<blockquote>'User Expectations' create 'Requirements' create 'Design Architectures' create 'Implementations'\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"40\" style=\" \">So, here is how our basic frontend requirements can be broken down:\n</p>\n<p id=\"41\" style=\" \">We\u2019re designing for:\n</p>\n<ul id=\"42\">\n  <li>Small Screens</li>\n  <li>Large Screens</li>\n</ul>\n<p id=\"43\" style=\" \">Each screen can have:\n</p>\n<ul id=\"44\">\n  <li>Collapsed View</li>\n  <li>Expanded View</li>\n</ul>\n<p id=\"45\" style=\" \">For each of the above views, the following cases apply:\n</p>\n<ul id=\"46\">\n  <li>User not logged in</li>\n  <li>User logged in</li>\n</ul>\n<p id=\"47\" style=\" \">For each of these case, the following cases apply:\n</p>\n<ul id=\"48\">\n  <li>No Annotations to read</li>\n  <li>Some annotations to read</li>\n  <li>The user tries to make annotation</li>\n</ul>\n<p id=\"49\" style=\" \">A simple stacked layout. Looks the same in all kinds of screens. Except one thing, on large screens, we don\u2019t want it to look too wide, but centered on the screen, and on small screens it must occupy the complete width of the screen. Research indicates that about 65 to 70 letters is what humans in general are comfortable reading in a line without the line being too short to be abrupt, or too long to render it incomprehensible in a single pass. So, on large screens, we\u2019ll not want more than 65-70 characters.\n</p>\n<p id=\"50\" style=\" \">\n  <mark><em>Note: I\u2019m using SASS for writing my CSS files. One, because it is as easy (or as tough) as writing CSS, and two, because it is less tedious than writing CSS, and is, as its name goes <a href=\"http://sass-lang.com/\" target=\"_blank\">\u2018Syntactically Awesome StyleSheets\u2019</a>.Some of the declarations have been taken from the <a href=\"http://getbootstrap.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Bootstrap 3</a> framework, since that is what we have tinkered for our own needs on the portal too.</em> \n  </mark>\n</p>\n<p id=\"51\" style=\" \">So, initially it was like:\n</p>\n<p id=\"52\" style=\" \"> \n</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: sass\">article{\nwidth:100%;    \nmargin: 0 auto;\nline-height: 1.5;\nletter-spacing: 1px;\nfont-size: 1.5rem;\ntext-align: justify;\n}\n</pre>\n<p id=\"53\" style=\" \"> \n</p>\n<p id=\"54\" style=\" \">The text looks too much cornered, don\u2019t you think? So, we could add a margin on both sides, by changing the margin property to:\n</p>\n<p id=\"55\" style=\" \"> \n</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: sass\">margin: 0 10px;\n</pre>\n<p id=\"56\" style=\" \"> \n</p>\n<p id=\"57\" style=\" \">But, by doing so, we now see horizontal scroll bar and some text moving out of the viewport. So, we fix that by reducing our width in percentages, and still centering them.\n</p>\n<p id=\"58\" style=\" \"> \n</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: sass\">width:95%;    \nmargin: 0 auto;\n</pre>\n<p id=\"59\" style=\" \"> \n</p>\n<p id=\"60\" style=\" \">But, this looks too spread out at desktop screens, so, we add a media query for our approximate width on bigger screens:\n</p>\n<p id=\"61\" style=\" \"> \n</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: sass\">@media(min-width: $screen-md){\nwidth: 60rem;\n}\n</pre>\n<p id=\"62\" style=\" \"> \n</p>\n<p id=\"63\" style=\" \">rem is size with respect to size of root element (which we\u2019ve set to 14px). This makes the overall width as \n  <var>14 \n  </var>x \n  <var>60 \n  </var>= \n  <var>840 \n  </var>px. That can help deciding the breakpoint too, where we must transition from the rem version to 95%. Anyhow, our \n  <code>$screen-md \n  </code> variable is set to \n  <code>992px \n  </code>, so we\u2019ve transitioned way before that.\n</p>\n<p id=\"64\" style=\" \">The completed code of the page looks like the one in the pen below\n</p>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n  <p class=\"codepen\" data-default-tab=\"result\" data-height=\"316\" data-slug-hash=\"OPYLop\" data-theme-id=\"13781\" data-user=\"anshulthakur\" style=\" \">See the Pen <a href=\"http://codepen.io/anshulthakur/pen/OPYLop/\">Annotations Tutorial (Part 1): Final</a> by Anshul Thakur (<a href=\"http://codepen.io/anshulthakur\">@anshulthakur</a>) on <a href=\"http://codepen.io\">CodePen</a>.\n  </p>\n  <script async=\"\" src=\"//assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js\">\n  </script>\n</div>\n<p id=\"65\" style=\" \"> \n</p>\n<p id=\"66\" style=\" \">Hokay, so this looks fine for small as well as large screens.\n</p>\n<p id=\"67\" style=\" \">\n</p><pre class=\"brush: sass\">.oval-speech {\n  position:relative;\n  \n  min-width: 25px;\n  min-height: 20px;\n  width:auto;\n  \n  padding: 0;\n  margin: 0;\n  \n  text-align:center;\n  color:#fff;\n  background:#5a8f00;\n  /* css3 */\n  @include background-gradient(#b8db29, #5a8f00);\n  \n  @include border-radius(100%, 100%);\n  }\n  \n  @mixin background-gradient($start-color: #555, $end-color: #333, $start-percent: 0%, $end-percent: 100%){\n  background:-webkit-gradient(linear, 0 $start-percent , 0 $end-percent, from( $start-color ), to( $end-color ));\n  background:-moz-linear-gradient($start-color, $end-color);\n  background:-o-linear-gradient($start-color, $end-color);\n  background:linear-gradient($start-color, $end-color);\n  background-repeat: repeat-x;\n  filter: progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.gradient(startColorstr='#{ie-hex-str($start-color)}', endColorstr='#{ie-hex-str($end-color)}', GradientType=1); // IE9 and down\n }\n \n @mixin border-radius($x-radius: 0px, $y-radius: 0px ) {\n  -webkit-border-top-left-radius:$x-radius $y-radius;\n  -webkit-border-top-right-radius:$x-radius $y-radius;\n  -webkit-border-bottom-right-radius:$x-radius $y-radius;\n  -webkit-border-bottom-left-radius:$x-radius $y-radius;\n  //Escape \n  -moz-border-radius:#{$x-radius}/#{$y-radius};\n  -ms-border-radius:#{$x-radius}/#{$y-radius};\n  border-radius:#{$x-radius}/#{$y-radius};\n}\n</pre>\n<p id=\"69\" style=\" \"></p>\n<p id=\"68\" style=\" \">Lets move on to the next task.

Converting Annotations tutorial - Part 1
{"Body": " <p id=\"1\" style=\" \">I like how the comments look like on Medium.com. I am a compulsive scribbler when it comes to the corners and margins of hard-copies and THAT is something I dearly miss in e-reading, other than the comfort of reading from a book, than from a radiating screen. When I first saw this on Medium, I liked it right away. That was the time when I had no idea that I\u2019d be doing web development at all (which also means that I didn\u2019t know web development).</p>\n<p id=\"2\" style=\" \">While the efficacy of such \u2018notes\u2019 on web articles is a long debated topic, with Medium Website standing as a colossal corroboration of \u2018it works!\u2019, but the arguments blared by horns of the opposing pavillion are just as sound. Notes have their place, but they cannot exactly replace comments. Buuut, they do make the articles personal! For it is totally up to you to comment on one particular paragraph, or a selection of lines, and not on the entire piece. Also, not everyone reads the neatly folded annotations. So, where do they work, and where they don\u2019t?</p>\n<p id=\"3\" style=\" \">An annotation that is longer than the post does not work. For that (if you really intend to do so), we have comments. Plus, if we can control the privacy of annotations, they can really benefit as notes in a personal book while helping preserve the context of the thought. As a result, I\u2019d want to make one for our project, and now have a working prototype.</p>\n<p id=\"4\" style=\" \">I\u2019ll admit that the inspiration is Medium.com website, while the various options of how to go about the problem were evaluated from this post of StackOverflow. Then, I found this little project \u2018Sidecomments.js\u2019 which had a replica of medium-like commenting system. I tried to use it (since I barely knew JS or Jquery back then) and when it did not work (since it needed Require.js, and perhaps Node.js), I pulled up my sleeves for making one myself in vanilla JS (in a bid to learn JS) and well, for the fun of it.</p>\n<p id=\"5\" style=\" \">So, this is what we would like to make:\r\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"6\">A notes app that allows us to make comments, hereafter referred to as Annotations, on article content, then and there.</li>\n<li id=\"7\">Allows the user to tune its privacy, allowing them to make it public, private, visible to self and author, and to a user entered list of friends.</li>\n</ol>\n<p id=\"8\" style=\" \">There are certain concerns that this evokes:\r\n</p>\n<ol id=\"9\">\n<li>How do we identify what comments were made on what paragraph?</li>\n<li>What if that paragraph or content is deleted?</li>\n<li>What if the author of the article wants to respond but only let the author of annotation know?</li>\n</ol>\n<p id=\"10\" style=\" \">So, here is how we answered them:\r\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"11\">\n<h3>How do we identify what comments were made on what paragraph?</h3>\n<p style=\" \">We developed an engine in our content app, which assigns unique IDs to each content type on which annotations can be created by the user before it is saved to the database. For every article, these IDs usually start from 1. The obvious limitation being that the we cannot have annotations on a page where more than one content entry is being displayed. I think that is okay, for annotations on blurb listing pages would be absurd for me. Anytime the content gets updated, the previous IDs remain intact (unless the content is deleted, of course). Even in the event of content deletion, the ID is never reused (it is a linear list which constantly increments). The annotations are saved with keys to their article and its paragraph ID.\r\n    </p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"12\">\n<h3>What if that paragraph or content is deleted?</h3>\n<p style=\" \">The answer lies not in how we save annotations, but in how we display it. Annotations are displayed in two places on a page. One is where they belong, on the margins of the text. Next, they are also collected down in a separate tab adjacent to the comments tab. If there are some orphaned annotations, you can find them in this annotation bucket. Plus, if you want to treat them as regular comments, so be it, they are here, at the bottom of the page.</p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"13\">\n<h3>What if the author of the article wants to respond but only let the author of annotation know?</h3>\n<p style=\" \">Since we\u2019ve already proposed that we\u2019d want to maximize tunability of privacy in our projects, scalability of such flexibility is paramount. But we have to make tradeoffs to make something work, and since we value your privacy more than anything, we\u2019ve found our answer in dealing with this problem outside the context of annotations. But to understand the rationale of our solution, you\u2019ll have to understand what annotations mean to us.</p>\n<p style=\" \">Annotations are personal interjections, or ponderings that happen while reading an article. They are not exactly debatable, but can be a short feedback of sorts to authors, something said by a person to a person, and not broadcasted to everyone. You could think of them as review comments before they are published, the usual reviewing stuff that goes around while content writing. The problem here is, not one, but many people will make such annotations.</p>\n<p style=\" \">Thus, annotations that are aimed at starting conversations must result into conversations. However, they mustn\u2019t do so on the post, but in the privacy of message boxes.</p>\n<p style=\" \">Say, a person made a public annotation on an article, and somebody wanted to respond to it. He can respond to it via a message. This is possible rather easily because the other person too is a member (since annotations are for signed up users only). This can lead to great friendships and establishing novel social study circles while keeping the article relatively clean of the informal chatter that might then take place. The concept of group messaging shall allow more people to join in the conversation should the two (original people in conversation) oblige unanimously. Unanimous vote is required because even one person who does not oblige will be offended, and if that is so, we have a problem.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<br/>\n<p id=\"14\" style=\" \"><i>[Also know that all of these are pipelined. So, Friendship circles, as of now does not exist on our portal (we\u2019re on our way though!). Thus, you could think of this requirement as a part of a bigger charter, and only the relevant parts would be implemented for now.</i></p>\n<p id=\"15\" style=\" \"><i>But rest assured, as and when the segments are added to the portal, the tutorials will also be updated.]</i></p>\n", "pid_count": " 15"}

Everybody was returning from their Diwali vacations, the rush was obvious. I felt like an idiot to not have considered it beforehand; wasn't it the same reason why I had booked the return train tickets well in advance? So, the chances of getting a Volvo seat were quite bleak. I stood in line, nevertheless, vacillating in my mind between staying in that line or moving into the currently empty queue for the normal bus adjacent to the luxury counter. In between this contemplation, a person accosted me and introduced himself as someone from the nearby taxi stand and offered to take me to Delhi for 900 rupee. 900 rupee is almost double the cost from Chandigarh, but I thought that emergency times require expensive steps. Besides, 900 rupee was okay to me. My bus tickets would have cost around 550 bucks or so for a Volvo after such a long waiting time. So, at least I was getting the comfort of a car, I thought, and acquiesced. However, he needed 5 more people, and when he asked the people next to me, they refused, saying it was too much. It was.

Ashish. It turned out that he was from Bilaspur, so we indeed had something more in common. We didn't have anything else to talk about for the rest of the journey except once, when others stopped the cab to buy beer. He was surprised that the three of the other people travelling with us knew each other.

And I was headed to Delhi anyway.

But was it?</span></font></p>\n<p align=\"justify\" id=\"10\" style=\" \"><font face=\"Times New Roman, serif\"><span style=\" \">The three of these people started talking, starting from Shiv Sena. The fourth one butted in his opinion about how he hated the Thackreys. He spoke with such indignation as if he had some personal grudge with the family. I found it amusing and was almost sure that this guy knew nothing of Maharashtra or the Thackreys more than what shouting they do on the TV and the kind of goonda activities their activists in other states are notorious for. For reasons that will unfold later, I shall refer to him as the \u2018Broker\u2019. Then, another one said that some party in Punjab, I think it was the Baadal\u2019s, who were to Punjab what Shiv Sena is to Maharashtra, a pest (according to them). Talk then shifted to Punjab and its political past, and one of those three people tried to include the driver - who was a aged Sardaar - into their conversation. They asked about Bhindranwale, and one of these people whom they called Mamaji (by which name, I shall refer him for the rest of this narrative for he reminded me of Mama Shakuni), rejected him as a bad person (with a \u2018</span></font><font face=\"Times New Roman, serif\"><i><span style=\" \">mc</span></i></font><font face=\"Times New Roman, serif\"><span style=\" \">\u2019 slang). The driver said that he knew everything, and that this person, Jarnail Singh, was not a bad person at all. The only wrong thing he did was to stand against Indira Gandhi and Zail Singh, and was then cajoled into propagating the slogan of Khalistan. I found it very amusing how he asserted himself '</span></font><font face=\"Times New Roman, serif\"><i><span style=\" \">humko sab pata hai</span></i></font><font face=\"Times New Roman, serif\"><span style=\" \">' (I know everything about it). He then told how he was in transport back then, and even during the Emergency, when it was curfew hours past six, his bus was never stopped at checkposts by the police. He said that they stopped everyone, but not him as if he were someone special to them, or perhaps too regular to be dangerous. He might be knowing something, he might not. But neither did the other people who weren\u2019t even born when these events occurred, and absolutely not me, I know nothing of Punjab's history. But their talks made me feel sorry for not knowing Himachal's history.</span></font></p>\n<p align=\"justify\" id=\"11\" style=\" \"><font face=\"Times New Roman, serif\"><span style=\" \">The talks drifted to Gurdaas Maan, whom one lauded for being a humble person, who meets people every Saturday. And that his music was the best in Punjab. The Mamaji chimed in his wavering drunken voice (it sounded drunk even when he wasn't) and said how '</span></font><font face=\"Times New Roman, serif\"><i><span style=\" \">maamla gadbad hai</span></i></font><font face=\"Times New Roman, serif\"><span style=\" \">' which Maan appeared (I thought it was a song he had sung) in 80s is still his favorite and how it was a rage back then. The driver told how Maan was his classmate and even then he was a good singer, but a very shy guy.</span></font></p>\n<p align=\"justify\" id=\"12\" style=\" \"><font face=\"Times New Roman, serif\"><span style=\" \">Talks then shifted to movies, and how these people liked '</span></font><font face=\"Times New Roman, serif\"><i><span style=\" \">Bang bang</span></i></font><font face=\"Times New Roman, serif\"><span style=\" \">' but did not like </span></font><font face=\"Times New Roman, serif\"><i><span style=\" \">'Haider'</span></i></font><font face=\"Times New Roman, serif\"><span style=\" \">. Well, it was a first for me. So far, I had heard things quite opposite to it. They said that Haider was too slow and confusing. Then one of them said that it is based on Shakespeare's play, the other confirmed it is Hamlet. The first one wondered if Shakespeare really did write a story on Kashmir. I was laughing out loud in my head. The other one said, \u201cno, but he must have written something dealing with patriotism and the nation\u201d. They didn't know how old Shakespeare is. One guy said that Shakespeare's stories are very complex, not everyone can understand them. I knew the kind of intellectual level they had. 4 of them. Ashish was busy trying to sleep.</span></font></p>\n<p align=\"justify\" id=\"13\" style=\" \"><font face=\"Times New Roman, serif\"><span style=\" \">But then, I quickly realized that I was wrong. Books are not the only thing in this world and though I may not agree completely, but books are not indispensible. These people I was with, they knew a lot of Punjab's history, and movies, both Hindi and Punjabi, and actors, and dates, musician names, their art, and critique. There existed a social intelligence that these people carried. One of them was trying to engage the driver into good talk. He was in some kind of hotel business, or hotel industry, owned a car in Ghaziabad with its insurance overdue, and yet running on road. He said it was Ghaziabad, cars don\u2019t run on rules there. The other one who had been cursing the Punjabi songs playing in the car - which he did not understand - while the driver was out at the filling station, later asked the driver if he had only Punjabi songs. When he got a no, he said that the songs were very nice, in a very approving way. No one could suspect that he had been foulmouthing those songs half an hour ago. He too had a car and its insurance is due in December but the agent had called him to remind of its renewal in October itself, while he was not planning to get insurance at all. This guy seemed like a double player to me, the \u2018</span></font><font face=\"Times New Roman, serif\"><i><span style=\" \">munh mein Ram, bagal mein chhoori</span></i></font><font face=\"Times New Roman, serif\"><span style=\" \">\u2019 type (Google tells me that \u2018a honey tongue with a heart of gall\u2019 is its English equivalent). And he had a beautiful face, and a good imperial moustache. Oh, and an orange shirt that said '</span></font><font face=\"Times New Roman, serif\"><i><span style=\" \">nice stache</span></i></font><font face=\"Times New Roman, serif\"><span style=\" \">' in black. I knew he knew it and wore the shirt on purpose.</span></font></p>\n<p align=\"justify\" id=\"14\" style=\" \"><font face=\"Times New Roman, serif\"><span style=\" \">He was indeed a player, and hence I would refer to him as the </span></font><font face=\"Times New Roman, serif\"><i><span style=\" \">\u2018Gamer\u2019</span></i></font><font face=\"Times New Roman, serif\"><span style=\" \">. He seemed to be double timing. To one of his girls, he was sending and receiving voice chats on whatsapp, while with the other, he had been like, trying to floor her. Sitting in the back seat, I could read what he was writing and what she wrote back (If you find that this is invasion of privacy and want to stop, then I am okay with that). Our Gamer was being honest in one sense - he admitted to her that he was not the good guy she thought him to be. But call it foolishness, but the girl replied back that she knew it and he must also know she isn't good either. Maybe she too was being honest. At one point he writes, '</span></font><font face=\"Times New Roman, serif\"><i><span style=\" \">I'll make sure you fall in luv wid me</span></i></font><font face=\"Times New Roman, serif\"><span style=\" \">', and then, in the very next line, after a pause of few seconds, writes '</span></font><font face=\"Times New Roman, serif\"><i><span style=\" \">dnt fall*</span></i></font><font face=\"Times New Roman, serif\"><span style=\" \">'. Talk of sending mixed signals. This guy was its master. This, he managed to do while also talking to other two (Mamaji and the Hotel guy) and planning a trip to Kathmandu, instead of Thailand this December. The Broker was from Nainital, and when our Gamer came to know that, he said that people from Nainital are very good. He told how he had a girlfriend from Nainital, and she was very good. They had lots of fun (think whatever you want, I have nothing to comment). No one could hear what he spoke in those voice chats to the other girl, and what she said back. This guy is intelligent, I thought. The Broker said that Kathmandu is a nice place and somehow managed to correlate his being from Nainital to the knowledge of Kathmandu, which he had never visited, in such a way that he became their definitive reference for the streets of Kathmandu. He talked as if Kathmandu was just on the adjacent mountain top, stone throw distance from Nainital. I don't know, I've never been to Nainital either. But they inquired him about the kind of girls they'd find there, are only Nepali girls available? Or Indian too, and stuff. I had only recently learned at home that gambling is a favourite passtime of many Nepalis, and Kathmandu streets had lots of such, benches. He replied in an affirmative like a Broker (Dalaal, and hence the name), all sorts were available. This guy was overreaching to establish rapport, that is what I think. Nevertheless, the Gamer saved his number.</span></font></p>\n<p align=\"justify\" id=\"15\" style=\" \"><font face=\"Times New Roman, serif\"><span style=\" \">This Broker was also the one to claim that beer tasted best in Delhi, and the other three agreed to him unanimously. They thanked beer to make the cumbersome travel more bearable. Bearable? They were sitting in the effing front seats, all seats for themselves. The three of us, the strangers were in the back seat with me in the middle.</span></font></p>\n<p align=\"justify\" id=\"16\" style=\" \"><font face=\"Times New Roman, serif\"><span style=\" \">An important advantage of taking initiative in such situations is that the three got the comfortable seats. We all were paying the same amount of money, so why should anyone get an uncomfortable seat? There should have been seat rotation, but it wasn't discussed. This Bilaspur guy probably had it worst, in the left corner. The Mamaji in front of him just rolled his seat back and this guy was huddled into the space. The headrest too was more of an unwelcome addition. The guy on the right might also have had my sympathies, but then, he thanked beer, so no sympathies for someone to have a good time. While we stopped midway, Ashish offered me is seat. I didn't want it, but how do you say no? I made a mistake of getting in before him, and he climbed from the same door, that I had, while I was asking him to come from the other side. So I shuffled around a bit and then discovered that sitting over a seat belt stick was way better that with an uncomfortable headrest in the back. Plus my occupancy requirements were a little larger for I was taller. I should have used this \u2018tall card\u2019 in the beginning. My head was touching the ceiling on the back seat. I should have asked for the seats in the middle. But had that happened, I'd have missed the Whatsapp fun. You see, voyeuristic tendencies abound. Nevertheless, I made sure that Mamaji will have to sleep while sitting erect if he so desired. When he tried to push his seat back again, it didn't budge. My knees and the rest of my body were obstructing its movement while my heart was hula hooping with momentary triumph. He tried twice or thrice, then gave up. He slid down and sideways. On the next stop, I was back in the middle of the last seat.</span></font></p>\n<p align=\"justify\" id=\"17\" style=\" \"><font face=\"Times New Roman, serif\"><span style=\" \">When the driver pulled over for dinner, Mamaji asked him to leave dinner for they'd have dinner at home. The driver retorted that </span></font><font face=\"Times New Roman, serif\"><i><span style=\" \">'you might have dinner at home, but what I have of home is these restaurants, I've got to eat</span></i></font><font face=\"Times New Roman, serif\"><span style=\" \">.' Quite a character, our driver was. But he said it quite clearly, and because I didn't feel like dining anymore, I chewed on what he had just said. That was quite an emotional statement, don't you think?</span></font></p>\n<p align=\"justify\" id=\"18\" style=\" \"><font face=\"Times New Roman, serif\"><span style=\" \">I had begun to suspect that I might not be able to catch even the last metro. We entered the borders of Delhi by 10:30, and the last metro leaves Kashmere gate at 11:15. If there would be traffic, I'd certainly miss it. I was planning to call Meru cabs or some other service, but then, the sense of adventure, or rather, the guilt of adventure took over - '</span></font><font face=\"Times New Roman, serif\"><i><span style=\" \">let's see what happens</span></i></font><font face=\"Times New Roman, serif\"><span style=\" \">'. We reached Kashmere gate by 11:05 and after a few hasty and obligatory handshakes, I rushed across the overhang bridge towards the metro station through ISBT. From a distance, I saw people retreating from the place that used to have one of the exits from ISBT. 11 at night, it had been shut down. So, I changed direction, to find another way (I didn\u2019t know if there was one). There was one, climb the stairs to the higher floor, and get out. I rushed. Thanks to the metro card, I didn't have to stand in line which was still long considering the time of the day, or rather night. The X Ray machine was out of order, so I had to open the suitcase I was carrying, apples, and clothes. The guards knew that it was closing time and were a little lax, asking people to hurry and catch the last train home. (I know, that is the song I had on my mind back then, \u2018last train home\u2019 by Lost Prophets). Anyhow, I rushed and made it with Metro's ETA of 3 minutes.</span></font></p>\n<p align=\"justify\" id=\"20\" style=\" \"><font face=\"Times New Roman, serif\"><span style=\" \">It is amazing how even the last metro was crowded. In normal times, I'd have let the train pass for the next one, but then, it was the last train. I don't know why, but people huddle around the gates. An elderly person asked me where was I headed. When I told him about it, he said, that is far, and that I should get a seat. I was like, '</span></font><font face=\"Times New Roman, serif\"><i><span style=\" \">why not, look at all these empty seats, if I can get these people to vacate it.</span></i></font><font face=\"Times New Roman, serif\"><span style=\" \">' The other gate was feeling secluded, so I offered it some company. There was room for two, I and my Aristocrat occupied it. I finally reached my Delhi home at 12:15, when I called my mother, and she was still feeling quite guilty.</span></font></p>\n<p align=\"justify\" id=\"21\" style=\" \"><font face=\"Times New Roman, serif\"><span style=\" \">I started out at 10 in the morning, while the other times, I start at 10:30. I most certainly reach by 10:30 when traveling by train, and today I reached by 12. If I travel by bus, I start by 7:30 and reach by 6. In any case, my entire day is wasted anyhow, so I prefer the freedom of movement and the availability of a toilet in the train to the tiredness and soreness in my bums and legs and the need to drink less water to not want to pee as a result. But then look again, I did have an adventure of sorts. I met people living an entirely different life, a totally different angle. Funny thing to note is, which is also the observation I made in the cab, I was almost invisible to the group. I didn't offer any opinion, nor anyone inquired about me. I was comfortable in listening to their ways and methods. For them, I was a necessary burden, for I paid 600 rupee, making them profitable by at least a hundred bucks, so you could say that their beer was on me. For me, they are now, just 6 characters that fit in a temporary, makeshift story.</span></font></p>\n<p align=\"justify\" id=\"22\" style=\" \"><br/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/media/images/2014/11/22/invisible.jpg\" style=\" \"/></p>\n", "pid_count": " 22"}

Converting Doing C OOP Style: Structure members as Class Attributes
{"content": "<p id=\"1\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', cursive;\">In this post, we are going to discuss a classy technique to assign values to members of a structure in C programming language as if they were some members of a class in some OOP language.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p id=\"2\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', cursive;\">You might be knowing that C language does not natively support Object Oriented Programming constructs and that if you are to do programming in an object oriented fashion, you need specialized languages like C++, Python, PHP or Java as the immediate recourse. But, knowing that C++ and Python have been written in C, it cannot be possible that C metamorphosizes into something entirely different when it transitions into C++ or any other High Level Language. If we can do OOP in C++, then there must be some way to do it in C too, though with a lot more effort. Now, I am not a OOPs specialist, infact I don&#39;t understand it very well in implementation due to lack of exposure. I code in C for a living, but somewhere between coding in C and making the code more scalable and modular, I&#39;ve rediscovered the need to have something we now call Objects. I&#39;d tell you the story some other day, today, I just wish to demonstrate how a very close parallel of Object Classes can be developed inside C knowing what we already know and perhaps, a little bit new information. Now remember, it isn&#39;t the final form of&nbsp;<code>class</code>&nbsp;that you might be expecting. C does not support classes natively, (but it can be made to do so through hard, incremental work if the cause is justified). What we&#39;re doing here is the beginning of it, were&#39;re starting to model things what an Object Oriented perspective.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p id=\"3\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', cursive;\">The closest parallel to a class from OOP in C is a structure. It is like, classes are structures, with a lot of bling. While I&#39;ll keep the discussion of a more complex class for some other post, I&#39;ll show you three methods in which a structure and its members may be declared. You might be aware of two of them, but the third one is more cool (actually it strikes a middle ground between two methods). Without further ado, lets do it with an example.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p id=\"5\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', cursive;\"><img alt=\"Book as Struct\" src=\"http://aestheticblasphemy.com/sites/default/files/field/image/book_structure.gif\" /></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p id=\"4\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', cursive;\">Consider the example of representing books as our black box unit of representation. A book has various attributes, or properties which help us identify it without having to look inside, the most generic being:</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', cursive;\">Title of Book</span></span></li>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', cursive;\">Author(s)</span></span></li>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', cursive;\">ISBN</span></span></li>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', cursive;\">Genre</span></span></li>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', cursive;\">Publisher</span></span></li>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', cursive;\">Price</span></span></li>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', cursive;\">Edition</span></span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p id=\"7\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', cursive;\">For the present discussion let us assume there is just one author. First, we represent it as a structure in C.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n<span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', cursive;\"><code>typedef struct book_type {\r\n    unsigned char title[255]; \r\n    unsigned char author[255]; \r\n    unsigned long isbn; \r\n    unsigned char genre[255];\r\n    unsigned char publisher[255]; \r\n    unsigned int price_inr; \r\n    unsigned short edition; \r\n} BOOK;</code></span></span></pre>\r\n\r\n<p id=\"9\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', cursive;\">Right now, we&#39;ve just described how a structure will look like, i.e. it is a structure definition. We&#39;ve typedef-ed it to save our hands from typing the excruciatingly long &#39;<code>struct book</code>&#39; by merely writing &#39;<code>BOOK</code>&#39;; Not that it makes a difference here, but the names tend to get long as the complexity of the entire project increases and coding etiquette or guidelines come into force. So, now we can start filling in the data using different methods. Lets start with the &#39;here and now&#39; kind of method.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n<span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', cursive;\"><code>BOOK book = {\r\n    &quot;The C Programming Language&quot;, \r\n    &quot;Dennis Ritchie&quot;, \r\n    0131103628, \r\n    &quot;Technical&quot;, \r\n    &quot;Prentice Hall&quot;, \r\n    146, \r\n    2 };</code></span></span></pre>\r\n\r\n<p id=\"6\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', cursive;\">Here, we are telling everything in sequence and in one place. Short and sweet, but we need to keep in mind the exact order of the members and the data type of that member. This is called the&nbsp;<em><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Struct_(C_programming_language)\" target=\"_blank\">C89-style initializers</a>&nbsp;style.&nbsp;</em>But that short and sweet is a bitter pill when the number of structures is large, and so are the number of members in it. Also, data types aren&#39;t the only things that go into a structure. Even functions can (and that, gentlemen and ladies, &nbsp;is how we&#39;ll make a class). So, we&#39;d like a more flexible style. Yep, we have that too; here:</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n<span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', cursive;\"><code>BOOK book;\r\nbook.title =&nbsp;&quot;The C Programming Language&quot;;\r\nbook.author =&nbsp;&quot;Dennis Ritchie&quot;;\r\nbook.isbn =&nbsp;&nbsp;0131103628;\r\nbook.genre =&nbsp;&quot;Technical&quot;;\r\nbook.publisher =&nbsp;&quot;Prentice Hall&quot;;\r\nbook.price_inr = 146;\r\nbook.edition = 2;</code></span></span></pre>\r\n\r\n<p id=\"14\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', cursive;\">Much better? I don&#39;t know if it also has a technical name. But did you see how much did we had to type? Compare it with the previous method. So much for flexibility! But then, there is a third method which is the essential take away from this post. Lets see it first and then discuss it later.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n<span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', cursive;\"><code>BOOK book = {\r\n    .title = &quot;The C Programming Language&quot;&nbsp;,\r\n    .author = &quot;Dennis Ritchie&quot;&nbsp;,\r\n    .isbn = 0131103628&nbsp;,\r\n    .genre = &quot;Technical&quot;,\r\n    .publisher = &quot;Prentice Hall&quot;&nbsp;,\r\n    .price_inr = 146,\r\n    .edition = 2\r\n    };</code></span></span></pre>\r\n\r\n<p id=\"15\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', cursive;\">This is the middle ground between the previous two approaches. We don&#39;t need to enter anything in a particular order, and at the same time don&#39;t need to write&nbsp;<code>book.xxx</code>&nbsp;prefix to each attribute of the structure. This is more compact when we already know what to assign to each member. This also comes in handy when we are trying to write pointers to functions which can be thought of as methods of a class.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p id=\"13\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', cursive;\">Why do I compare this declaration with OOPs, because when we initialize an object, we populate all of its members and methods (in case of an interface), encapsulation being the key driver for such approach here. By extending this structure using unions or structures whose members are structures, we can implement class inheritance and by having pointer to functions, we can have some degree of encapsulation too. But we&#39;ll keep that discussion for some other day.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', cursive;\">(Image Credits:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.re-evolve.net/images/book_structure.gif\">Google</a>)</span></span></p>\r\n", "pid_count": "0"}


Converting 5 maxims for a programmer to live by
{"content": "<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"font-family:comic sans ms,cursive\">A day comes in the life of every programmer when they have to refactor someone else&#39;s code, or their own code, or fix a bug (heck, programmers spend a lot of time debugging someone else&#39;s crap as far as I know) and all hell breaks loose while deadlines tighten their noose around the&nbsp;neck. Here are a few simple practices that one can put to use in order to ease much of the future&nbsp;pain. They&#39;re not specific to any programming language, but generalizations which help keep things clean and less cluttered.
