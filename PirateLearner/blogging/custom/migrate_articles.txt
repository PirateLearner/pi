Converting Annotations Tutorial: User Form and annotation sorting
{"Body": " <p class=\"text-muted\" id=\"1\" style=\" \">In this part of our per-paragraph commenting annotations app, we create a dynamic form to post annotations on any paragraph and add some customization to the visibility of these annotations.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n<p id=\"2\" style=\" \">In the <a href=\"/C/course/computer-science/django/annotations-tutorial-dynamically-rendering-per-paragraph-annotations/16/\" target=\"_blank\">previous tutorial</a>, we finally loaded the annotations (from fixtures albeit) and associated them with their respective content blocks. Thus, if data starts coming from the backend now, we can pretty much handle it provided the <i>interface specifications</i> are strictly adhered to. Now, we want to finish some unfinished tasks.</p>\n\n<p class=\"text-center\" id=\"3\" style=\" \"><img alt=\"Bucket Lists\" class=\"img-responsive center-block\" src=\"/static/media/images/anshul/2015/04/09/annotations_7_1.jpg\" style=\" \"/><small><a href=\"http://thejuniornomads.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/bucketlist.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">(Image Credits)</a></small></p>\n\n<p id=\"4\" style=\" \">So far, the user has been able to only see what has been made already. There has been no means to add one's own annotations to the page. In this post, we take care of that lack by creating an annotation form.</p>\n\n<p id=\"5\" style=\" \">Also, so far, we've just seen that there are annotations. We haven't been able to see who made them (even though we put the user information in the fixtures in the last tutorial). So, we'd like to rectify that too.</p>\n\n<p id=\"6\" style=\" \">As another personalization to annotations, we'll by default neatly tuck in the annotations from other people into a small tab. The reason for doing so lies in the ends we are trying to achieve. Annotations are like the scribblings done on the margins of a book. I wouldn't like it if someone else scribbled in my books. The sense of ownership is lost. Similarly, annotations are supposed to be a personal thing. So, by default we must not be seeing other's annotations even if they don't mind us seeing theirs, just like they won't mind us reading their books. So, if you deliberately want to see what others might have said or thought about a particular para, you can look by expanding the tab with a single click, but not before that.</p>\n\n<ol id=\"7\">\n\t<li>Add form to page and test posting.</li>\n\t<li>Add user information fetched in JSON.</li>\n\t<li>Hide annotations from other people</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p id=\"8\" style=\" \">So, let's get started.</p>\n\n<p id=\"9\" style=\" \">We would like to see the users image and their name before their annotations.

We wanted to do that personalization thing, remember?</p>\n\n<p id=\"28\" style=\" \">Second, we're adding attributes to the 'Author' of the annotations now. If there are annotations created on that part by other users, we add their comments to the ' <code>other_annotations </code>' bucket and also unhide our 'Show annotations' button. Otherwise, it stays hidden.</p>\n\n<p id=\"29\" style=\" \">Okay. So, now that the user can make annotations, we will assume that the user information is present on the page right now as:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"brush: js\">annotations.currentUser = {\nuser_id: \"1\",\nuser_name: \"John Doe\",\nuser_gravatar: \"images/male.png\",\nuser_url: \"#\",\n};\n</pre>\n\n<p id=\"30\" style=\" \">Now, write the method to handle what happens on click as:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"brush: js\">var postAnnotation = function(e){\n/* Construct a JSON string of the data in annotation. */\n/* First find the parent's para-id */\nid = parseInt($(this).parents(\".annotation--container\").attr(\"data-section\"));\nconsole.log(\"Para ID: \"+ id);\n/* Current text must not be empty.

Converting Annotations Tutorial: Dynamically rendering per-paragraph annotations
{"Body": " <p class=\"text-muted\" id=\"1\" style=\" \">In this part of our per-paragraph commenting annotations app, we emulate the loading of annotations like they would with Ajax calls, and then associate each annotation with its respective content-block.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n<p class=\"text-center\" id=\"2\" style=\" \"><img alt=\"Sticky notes sticking out of novel pages\" class=\"img-responsive center-block\" src=\"/static/media/images/anshul/2015/04/08/annotations_6_1.jpg\" style=\" \"/><small><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/ny.chalkbeat.org/sites/default/files/2014/01/IMG_0282.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">(Image Credits)</a></small></p>\n\n<p id=\"3\" style=\" \"><a href=\"/C/course/computer-science/django/annotations-tutorial-adding-user-interactivity-with-jquery/15/\" target=\"_blank\">So far</a>, the annotations were just there when the page loaded as our page samples were fairly static. This means that the page was pieced together by the server before it was sent to the client browser where Javascript did what it did. While this could very well be the case, it seems like the content rendering and the annotation rendering engines are the same, or at least closely coupled. But loosely coupled, app-based designs are proliferating nowadays for they offer much more flexibility in terms of design, and are more easy to scale. Also, it makes a lot more sense.</p>\n\n<p id=\"4\" style=\" \">There are a few more considerations too.</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li id=\"5\">What the user primarily wants is to read the main content. I think that is the major motive why he/she is visiting the page, right? Thus, that part of the page must load with minimum hitch and clutter. If the user has a slow internet connection, there will be two things that would happen. First, if all data is collated and served in a single go, he'll only see the page once everything has arrived from the server. Until then he might see the text, but in a poorly formatted fashion (since CSS might not have loaded, or scripts are still waiting for the page to load completely). And second, the Javascripts usually work after the page is ready. Thus if Annotations are interspersed in between the main article, they are a nuisance to look at, big time. So, it would be much better if the loading of annotations can be delegated to a time after the main content has loaded.</li>\n\t<li id=\"6\">Annotations can also be made on the fly. That is why we are making them as close to the content, on the margin of the leaf. We haven't yet designed the form, but we'll do so in due time. We had wished that the user must not have to reload the page after posting each annotation he makes. This means, that we'd be using Ajax calls to post annotations in the future and updating the DOM through Javascript. In that event, a single annotation will be coming and going on the wire (when we are making the annotation). So, if it can come once, it can also come twice, or any number of time using the same Ajax methods. Then, why do we have to load the first instance through a different path of backend handling?</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p id=\"7\" style=\" \">So what we would like to do now, is to start from a state where there is no annotations belonging to any container. Also, you will remember that the boxed-up approach for clubbing the content and its annotations was done later. The base application (which renders the original content) may not want to change its template. Thus, we'll take care of manipulating the DOM to create those containers when annotations are loaded. Thus, here is our agenda:</p>\n\n<ol id=\"8\">\n\t<li>Load the page with as little as possible markup.</li>\n\t<li>Load annotations through Javascript (using fixtures in this case).</li>\n\t<li>Transform the page so that we may reach the state we demonstrated in iteration 4.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p id=\"9\" style=\" \">There are still a few pre-requisites for the markup though. It is loosely coupled, not completely decoupled design.</p>\n\n<ol id=\"10\">\n\t<li>The outermost block on which annotations would work must have the class</li>\n\t<li>Content blocks must have unique IDs</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p id=\"11\" style=\" \">Here, one may raise a doubt that when we are making an effort to have unique IDs for each content block and also having an identifier wrapping them all up, what is the problem with loading more markup so that the coupling of content-block and its annotations is rendered by the server itself. It is true, and I think this middle ground between everything on frontend and everything at backend is quite amicable. So, what we can do is load the skeleton layout from the backend rather than javascript manipulating the DOM to such extensive degree, while the Javascript may later fetch the annotations and put them in their respective containers. The only constraint placed in the backend template must be that it must not in any manner mess with the overall layout of content in case the Javascript fails to load.</p>\n\n<p id=\"12\" style=\" \">But for the current tutorial, we'll continue with our original idea, that the backend provides minimal markup while Javascript does the heavy-lifting.</p>\n\n<p id=\"13\" style=\" \">Other than that, there are a few bug-fixes we'd introduce.</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li id=\"14\">On mobile resolutions, when we click the annotations button, the sliding out is too abrupt. In fact, there is no sliding out. We'll smoothen that.</li>\n\t<li id=\"15\">The rolling out of content from the viewport on mid-size screens is smooth, but rolling back in isn't.</li>\n\t<li id=\"16\">The annotations must disappear if we click anywhere else on the screen.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p id=\"17\" style=\" \">On with it!</p>\n\n<p id=\"18\" style=\" \">First, the markup looks like it was in iteration 1, except that the paragraphs now have an ID, and the overall block has an ID. That is as much markup we want to start with.

But the second approach would be taxing (I'm not exactly sure though). In the article '<a href=\"/bookmarks/speeding-up-javascript-working-with-the-dom/6/\" target=\"_blank\">Speeding up JavaScript: Working with the DOM</a>', it is recommended that we \"<em>create multiple elements and insert them into the DOM triggering a single reflow. It uses something called a DocumentFragment. We create a DocumentFragment outside of the DOM (so it is out-of-the-flow). We then create and add multiple elements to this. Finally, we move all elements in the DocumentFragment to the DOM but trigger a single reflow.</em>\". We're not exactly using a DOM Fragment, but yes, we're making elements out-of-the-flow and only inserting them once we are done, so that there is only one reflow.</p>\n\n<p id=\"28\" style=\" \">Now, why did we clone it? If we just removed the entire container out of the flow, how would we know where we have to re-insert it later? For that, we'd either need to leave a placeholder there, which means creating a placeholder and inserting it there. Also if, God forbid, something went wrong with the Javascript in between (though that shouldn't really happen in production version) the reader would be left searching for the content in the want of what, annotations? Clearly content is more important to the reader.</p>\n\n<p id=\"29\" style=\" \">Also note that we've not just cloned the element, but also retained all the event handler and data attributes. That is just because we don't want to <em>assume</em> that our's will be the only or the first script to run on that content. We clearly don't want to annul anyone else's script effects.</p>\n\n<p id=\"30\" style=\" \"><strong>For each immediate child of the block, wrap the block in an annotation grouping:</strong></p>\n\n<pre class=\"brush: js\">annotationCopy.children().each(wrapContent);\n</pre>\n\n<p id=\"31\" style=\" \">Where <code>wrapContent </code> is:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"brush: js\">var wrapContent = function(){\nindex = parseInt($(this).attr('id'));\n$(this).wrap('&lt;div class=\"annotation--container clearfix\" data-section-id=\"'+index+'\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;');}\n</pre>\n\n<p id=\"32\" style=\" \"><strong>Append annotation container:</strong></p>\n\n<p id=\"33\" style=\" \">In the <code>wrapContent </code> method, append the following lines:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"brush: js\">$('&lt;div class=\"comments clearfix\"&gt;'+ \n  '&lt;h3 class=\"comments--toggle rectangular-speech\"&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;+\n  &lt;/p&gt;'+ \n  '&lt;div class=\"comments-container hidden\"&gt;'+ \n  '&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;').insertAfter($(this));\n</pre>\n\n<p id=\"34\" style=\" \">At this time, we've covered fair ground. So, let us reload the page to see how it looks. How does it look? Mine looks fine. I can now see annotation bubbles when I hover on their respective content blocks. Check the markup too (in the inspector to make sure the insertion and appending worked well.</p>\n\n<p id=\"35\" style=\" \"><strong>Load annotations:</strong></p>\n\n<p id=\"36\" style=\" \">Now that we've done the necessary groundwork, let us just load the annotations from fixed fixture for now. Later, they'll be served from the server via Ajax calls.</p>\n\n<p id=\"37\" style=\" \">But it would be good time to see what information we would want the annotations to contain so that they can be rendered and associated with:</p>\n\n<ol id=\"38\">\n\t<li>Annotation content.</li>\n\t<li>The content on which they were created.</li>\n\t<li>The user who created the annotation.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<pre class=\"brush: js\">{\ncontent_id: \"1\",\nparagraph_id: \"1\",\nannotation_body: \"Lorem Ipsum\",\nuser : {\nuser_id: \"1\",\nuser_name: \"John Doe\",\nuser_gravatar: \"images/default_large.png\",\nuser_url: \"#\",\n},\n}\n</pre>\n\n<p id=\"39\" style=\" \">I guess this is self-explanatory? What we will receive from the server will be a list of such objects encoded as JSON, and we'll parse them into our markup.</p>\n\n<p id=\"40\" style=\" \">Now, let's see how the call will take place later. We'll make an Ajax call to load annotations, and it will return asynchronously. For a successful response, we will have registered a callback function to which, control will be passed when the server replies. This function must then take that JSON formatted data, and render it into our markup. When we already know this much, let us write placeholder functions which can later be expanded for more complex tasks, like making the ajax query.</p>\n\n<p id=\"41\" style=\" \">First, we declare a few hand-code fixtures:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"brush: js\">fixtures = [\n    {\n        content_id: \"1\",\n        paragraph_id: \"1\",\n        annotation_body: \"Lorem Ipsum\",\n        user : {\n            user_id: \"1\",\n            user_name: \"John Doe\",\n            user_gravatar: \"images/default_large.png\",\n            user_url: \"#\",\n            },\n    },\n    {        \n    content_id: \"1\",\n    paragraph_id: \"1\",\n    annotation_body: \"Your documentation source should be written as regular Markdown files, and placed in a directory somewhere in your project.\",\n    user : {\n        user_id: \"2\",\n        user_name: \"Someone Else\",\n        user_gravatar: \"images/female.png\",\n        user_url: \"#\",\n        },\n    },\n    {        \n    content_id: \"1\",\n    paragraph_id: \"6\",\n    annotation_body: \"But we have to make tradeoffs to make something work\",\n    user : {\n        user_id: \"1\",\n        user_name: \"John Doe\",\n        user_gravatar: \"images/default_large.png\",\n        user_url: \"#\",\n        },\n    }\n];\n</pre>\n\n<p id=\"42\" style=\" \">As you can see, it is an array of objects with each object having a similar structure.</p>\n\n<pre class=\"brush: js\">var loadAnnotations = function(){\nrenderAnnotations(fixtures);\n};\n</pre>\n\n<p id=\"43\" style=\" \">This function currently makes a direct call into <code>renderAnnotations() </code> method as if the data was available. By doing this, we are trying to emulate how our Ajax call would have called that method.</p>\n\n<pre class=\"brush: js\">var renderAnnotations = function(data){\nconsole.log('Data received: ');\nfor(i=0; i&lt; data.length;i++){\n/* Find the parent container */\ncurrentObject = annotationCopy.children('[data-section-id=\"'+data[i]['paragraph_id']+'\"]');\n/* Find the annotations container inside that and append the comment */\ncurrentComment = $('');\ncurrentComment.text(data[i]['annotation_body']);\ncurrentObject.find('.comments-container').append(currentComment);\n/* Update the annotation count on the button */\ntemp = currentObject.find('.comments--toggle p').text();\ncommentCount = ((temp = currentObject.find('.comments--toggle p').text()) ==='+') ? 1 : (parseInt(temp)+1);\ncurrentObject.find('.comments--toggle p').text(commentCount);\n}\n};\n</pre>\n\n<p id=\"44\" style=\" \">Here, we iterate through all the data objects passed into the method, and try to find their parent containers (which we had created in the previous step). We are not doing any sorting here, just pick and drop, assuming that the backend server has taken care of ordering them for us according to some rule (sort by creation date, maybe?).</p>\n\n<p id=\"45\" style=\" \">For each annotation, we create its markup, and append it to the end of the <code>comment-container </code>, and also update its comment count. Note that this function does not assume how many comments are there before, or how many have come. This implies that we can reuse this method as it is at a later stage when we post new comments, and rest assured that the comment count will be updated, and the new annotation will be visible as soon as it is successful without disturbing the rest of the annotations.</p>\n\n<p id=\"46\" style=\" \"><strong>Update page:</strong></p>\n\n<p id=\"47\" style=\" \">Now that we've done all our processing, we can finally reattach our DOM subtree we've been morphing, into the DOM which will cause 1 reflow.</p>\n\n<pre class=\"brush: js\">$('#commentable-container').replaceWith(annotationCopy);\n</pre>\n\n<p id=\"48\" style=\" \">Then, we bind to the annotation bubbles to toggle the viewing and hiding of annotations.</p>\n\n<pre class=\"brush: js\">bindAnnotations();\n</pre>\n\n<p id=\"49\" style=\" \">Okay, so far so good. We've squeezed the elephant, now the only thing left is its tail. Let us attend to the minor bugs we mentioned at the beginning of the post.</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li id=\"50\">\n\t<p style=\" \"><strong>Transitions aren't smooth.</strong></p>\n\n\t<p style=\" \">Add the following to #annotations-container:</p>\n\n\t<pre class=\"brush: sass\">@media(min-width: $screen-md) and (max-width: $screen-lg){\ntransition: all 1s;        \n}\n</pre>\n\n\t<p style=\" \">The reason why it wasn't working on folding is because it was being applied to the class ' <code>annotations-active </code>' and when we clicked on the bubble, we removed that class. So, rather than changing the property, we were removing it altogether, and hence, it won't transition.</p>\n\n\t<p style=\" \">For the drop down effect, we are in a fix. I just discovered that CSS transitions will not work on <code>display </code> property. The reason is again the same as above. When we remove that class (hidden), it just ceases to exist, the browser doesn't make it fade away, but whoosh, it's gone. A few people recommended not touching the <code>display: block </code> property, but playing with the height and opacity properties. I did, but they too aren't producing the desirable effects. Another person suggested using the <code>keyframes </code> to control how animations occur. I tried that, and the results are just as good as fiddling with the height and opacity properties.</p>\n\n\t<pre class=\"brush: sass\">@keyframes fadeIn {\nfrom { opacity: 0; }\nto { opacity: 1; }\n}\n@mixin animation($function: fadeIn, $duration: .3s){\n-webkit-animation: $function $duration;\nanimation: $function $duration;\n}\n</pre>\n\n\t<p style=\" \">And using it in <code>.comments-container </code>:</p>\n\n\t<pre class=\"brush: sass\">@include animation(fadeIn, .15s);\n</pre>\n\n\t<p style=\" \">This isn't the most elegant solution, but certainly better than the abrupt nature of the previous versions. For a more smooth effect, I think we'll resort to jQuery, but later and only if it is too important.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li id=\"51\">\n\t<p style=\" \"><strong>Annotations must fold back on clicking anywhere other than the annotation.</strong></p>\n\n\t<p style=\" \">We'll use the ' <code>closest() </code>' method from jQuery, to find out if we are anywhere in the vicinity of the annotation we were working on. If we aren't, we can toggle it off. If we are, then we probably don't want to toggle them off yet.</p>\n\n\t<p style=\" \">Thus, we'll bind a click event to the entire document if any annotation is active. This event must be unbound when there are no annotations selected.</p>\n\n\t<p style=\" \">So, inside the ' <code>toggleAnnotations() </code>' method, we'd add the following lines for binding.

Converting Annotations Tutorial: Adding user interactivity with jQuery
{"Body": " <p class=\"text-muted\" id=\"1\" style=\" \">In this part of the per-paragraph commenting tutorial series, we are going to add the first bits of interactivity using Javascript to what we have acheived so far using purely CSS3 effects on HTML. The annotations must become visible when the user clicks on their bubbles, and not before.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n<p id=\"2\" style=\" \">Now that the basic layout and how things should look like in <a href=\"/C/course/computer-science/django/annotations-tutorial-speech-bubbles/12/\" target=\"_blank\">collapsed state</a> and <a href=\"/C/course/computer-science/django/annotations-tutorial-drawing-the-per-paragraph-comment-layout/13/\" target=\"_blank\">expanded states</a> have been visualized, we now move on to adding interactivity to them. In this section, we will add some user interactivity to the annotations - By default, the annotations must not be visible, but their speech buttons must be visible near the paragraph they are associated with, so that we have something we could click on. When the user clicks on the annotation button, the annotations become visible. Only the annotations corresponding to the content being clicked on should be visible, while safely hiding the rest.</p>\n\n<p id=\"3\" style=\" \">Okay? Okay!</p>\n\n<p class=\"text-center\" id=\"4\" style=\" \"><img alt=\"User interactivity in per-paragraph commenting app\" class=\"img-responsive center-block\" src=\"/static/media/images/anshul/2015/04/07/annotation_4_1.png\" style=\" \"/></p>\n\n<p id=\"5\" style=\" \">We could start off from readymade jQuery solutions, like the accordion, but spending few moments fiddling with it, I surmised that it would be better if we wrote one for ourselves which could handle both horizontal and vertical rolling out of our annotations.</p>\n\n<p id=\"6\" style=\" \">When I had originally started to develop this part of the per-paragraph annotations, I was a toddler with vanilla javascript and knew much too little of jQuery. Various people on discussion forums advices practicing vanilla JS and to get comfortable with it before getting to use jQuery for jQuery made things\u2026 a little too easy. So, I did make the entire thing in vanilla JS as much as possible, but couldn't help cheating when it came to Ajax calls. I did manage to do it (and the first version of annotations on PirateLearner runs on that code as of April 2015, so in case you are interested, you can look into that), but while doing so, I realized that I was reinventing the wheel, a lot. So, now I bring in the knowledge of the entire wheel, jQuery. We'll start to work on where we left off last time, using the same <a href=\"http://codepen.io/anshulthakur/pen/jEomEV/\" target=\"_blank\">code pen</a>.</p>\n\n<p id=\"7\" style=\" \">We're going to rely more on CSS3 transitions rather than Jquery DOM Manipulation and animation effects to achieve this. This is primarily because CSS3 transitions are <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10863000/is-it-better-to-use-jquery-fadein-or-css3-animations\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">GPU friendly</a> while jQuery is CPU intensive. Also, GPU acceleration is cool! So, our devices handle the previous one better. (Also that I haven't quite explored jQuery animations. There I said it!)</p>\n\n<p id=\"8\" style=\" \">So, here is what we will do. When the page loads, we will bind the click event on each of the annotation buttons for the function which must unroll or rollback the annotations for that respective content. Right now, we don't need to worry about which annotation belongs to which content, since they are cleanly laid out in our markup as siblings to a unique parent (which has a unique data-section-id).</p>\n\n<p id=\"9\" style=\" \">In the registered function, we need to find the parent, and then unhide the sibling with class name ' <code>comment </code>'. The CSS <code>transition </code> property will be used to animate the effect. Simple? But first, let us hide the annotations by default.</p>\n\n<p id=\"10\" style=\" \">Add class ' <code>hidden </code>' to <code>comments-container </code>. We add this class rather than adding a <code>display:none </code> style because toggling class is much simpler and does not interfere with the behaviour of the other classes.</p>\n\n<p id=\"11\" style=\" \">Now, let's get scripting:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"brush: js\">$(document).ready(function(){\n/* Find all annotation toggle buttons and bind the click event to them. */\n$('.comments--toggle').on('click', toggleAnnotations );\n});\n</pre>\n\n<p id=\"12\" style=\" \">Define the <code>toggleAnnotations </code> method:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"brush: js\">var toggleAnnotations = function(e){ /* find the parent with classname 'comments' */ $(this).parent('.comments').children('.comments-container').toggleClass('hidden'); };\n</pre>\n\n<p id=\"13\" style=\" \">Click on the buttons to see. See, simple, ain't it?</p>\n\n<p id=\"14\" style=\" \">Okay, onward! On medium width desktop screens, the article shifts even before we've clicked the annotations bubble. For this one too, it makes more sense to keep that effect in a different stylesheet class rather than manipulating the style element of the <code>commentable-container </code>. Why? Because the effect is supposed to come into play only for a range of screen widths (for medium screens that is), and is not universal.</p>\n\n<p id=\"15\" style=\" \">So, to the overall container with id 'commentable-container', we'll want a class which acts as a flag whether the annotations are visible or not. Lets name it annotations-active. It applies on the article section.</p>\n\n<pre class=\"brush: sass\">&amp;.annotations-active{\n@media(min-width: $screen-md) and (max-width: $screen-lg){\ntransform: translate(-25rem,0);\ntransition: all 1s;        \n}\n}\n</pre>\n\n<p id=\"16\" style=\" \">And update our script function toggleAnnotations() by adding the following:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"brush: js\">/* Add class annotations-active to the parent with ID commentable-container */\n$(this).parents(\"#commentable-container\").toggleClass('annotations-active');\n</pre>\n\n<p id=\"17\" style=\" \">Note the use of <code>parent() </code> and <code>parents() </code> methods. While parent would return only the immediate parent, parents()(will traverse back the entire DOM tree).</p>\n\n<p id=\"18\" style=\" \">Everything toggles just fine, unless we move from one annotation to another. In that case, the previous annotation stays put, and the next one also becomes visible. This is not the desired behaviour. The toggle class is to blame. Now, let us introspect a little. What do we want?</p>\n\n<p id=\"19\" style=\" \">When a user clicks on an annotation box, its respective annotations must unhide, <em>AND</em> the rest of them must hide. On clicking on it again, the annotations must hide again. Also, on clicking on any other annotation box, the current annotations must hide (which is essentially the same as our first line). As a cherry on top, we would want that when a particular annotation is active, its bubble has an active color.</p>\n\n<p id=\"20\" style=\" \">At this point, I'd rather use a state variable than any other logic. So, I'll introduce a variable which will contain the ID of the content for which annotations are currently active. It would also be a good time to enclose all our methods and variables into a single object to avoid writing into someone else's global variables.</p>\n\n<pre class=\"brush: js\">var annotations = {};\nannotations.currentAnnotation = 0;\nannotations.toggleAnnotations = function(e){...};\n</pre>\n\n<p id=\"21\" style=\" \">So anytime an annotation goes active, we update this variable with the ID of its parent container, deriving it from the <code>data-section-id </code>.</p>\n\n<p id=\"22\" style=\" \">Here's our new function:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"brush: js\">annotations.toggleAnnotations = function(e){\n/* \n* If the clicked annotation is the same is the one that was active, we need to close its annotations only,\n* otherwise we must close it and open the currently active's annotations.\n*/\nactiveID = parseInt($(this).parents('.annotation--container').attr('data-section-id'));\n/* Hide all other annotations first */\n$('.comments').children('.comments-container').addClass('hidden');\n/* If we clicked on the same bubble, it must collapse, and we return to initial state */\nif(annotations.currentAnnotation === activeID ){\n/* Remove the higlight class from the bubble: .annotation-highlight */\n$(this).removeClass('annotation-highlight');\n$(this).parents(\"#commentable-container\").removeClass('annotations-active');\nannotations.currentAnnotation = 0;\nreturn;\n}\n/* Else, we've selected a new bubble (and have already hidden everything.)*/\n/* Update state variable */\nannotations.currentAnnotation = parseInt($(this).parents('.annotation--container').attr('data-section-id'));\nconsole.log('Current Annotation is: ' + annotations.currentAnnotation);\n/* find the parent with classname 'comments' */\n$(this).addClass('annotation-highlight');\n$(this).parent('.comments').children('.comments-container').removeClass('hidden');\n/* Add class annotations-active to the parent with ID commentable-container */\nif(!$(this).parents(\"#commentable-container\").hasClass('annotations-active')){\n$(this).parents(\"#commentable-container\").addClass('annotations-active');\n}\n};\n</pre>\n\n<p id=\"23\" style=\" \">We'll explain it tomorrow (tomorrow never comes, read it once; if something is unclear, let me know. I'll redo it.). But there is one issue. When we click on a bubble, we desire that it must stay permanently ON until we click it off. This doesn't seem to be happening. Umm, hmm. A little look at the Element Inspector reveals that the style is being overridden by other styles. Wait, but why?</p>\n\n<p id=\"24\" style=\" \">The theory says, that other rules are more specific to the element. We'll get to it in a moment. But we could always quick fix it first by the sleight of hand? We'll just make the rule more focused on what we are trying to do, by moving the ' <code>annotation-highlight </code>' class into ' <code>comments-toggle </code>'. This also needs another poor change. Now every time we choose another annotation bubble, the first one must fade away. Since we're not storing the previous object in our state, but just its ID, it would be at least 3 lines of code to find the parent with that ID, and then removing the class from its sibling which has the class ' <code>comments-toggle </code>'. Rather, we've resorted to a quick shortcut - remove class from all of the objects. Since we know, as a matter of design that at an instant, only one object will have that class, the effect will apply to only one (though jQuery is supposedly doing it for all, which is much wasted effort). Here's what I think is the bad code which does the job:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"brush: js\">$('.comments--toggle').removeClass('annotation-highlight');\n</pre>\n\n<p id=\"25\" style=\" \">Let's also write that other option by stopping being lazy for a moment:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"brush: js\">$('*[data-section-id=\"'+annotations.currentAnnotation+'\"]').find('.comments--toggle').removeClass('annotation-highlight');\n</pre>\n\n<p id=\"26\" style=\" \">I said it was three lines and it is just one (though they actually are three lines, we've chained them together. :) ) The completed page is shown below:</p>\n\n<div class=\"center-block\">\n<p class=\"codepen\" data-default-tab=\"result\" data-height=\"257\" data-slug-hash=\"ogRyaK\" data-theme-id=\"13781\" data-user=\"anshulthakur\" style=\" \">See the Pen <a href=\"http://codepen.io/anshulthakur/pen/ogRyaK/\">Annotations Tutorial</a> by Anshul Thakur (<a href=\"http://codepen.io/anshulthakur\">@anshulthakur</a>) on <a href=\"http://codepen.io\">CodePen</a>.</p>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"//assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js\">\n  </script></div>\n\n<p id=\"27\" style=\" \">That does it!

You can start to tinker <a href=\"http://codepen.io/anshulthakur/pen/yyWYow/\" target=\"_blank\">here.</a></p>\n\n<div class=\"center-block\">\n<p class=\"codepen\" data-default-tab=\"result\" data-height=\"257\" data-slug-hash=\"yyWYow\" data-theme-id=\"13781\" data-user=\"anshulthakur\" style=\" \">See the Pen <a href=\"http://codepen.io/anshulthakur/pen/yyWYow/\">Annotations Tutorial: Making annotation bubbles</a> by Anshul Thakur (<a href=\"http://codepen.io/anshulthakur\">@anshulthakur</a>) on <a href=\"http://codepen.io\">CodePen</a>.</p>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"//assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js\">\n  </script></div>\n\n<hr/>\n<p id=\"3\" style=\" \">So far, we have a layout and signifier sign-posts to show that there are annotations in the form of speech bubbles. Now, we'd like to see how annotations would look like when visible. Here comes a fork: on a <b>large screen</b>, where we have enough estate to show annotations alongside the content, we would like it to appear there. But, this is not going to work for <b>mobile screens</b>. Why? Because if we stuff in both of them in a single row, each of them would either be clipped, or appear smaller than we want. We don't want the user to swipe left right to make annotations, but continue with their flow of downward scroll.</p>\n\n<p class=\"text-center\" id=\"4\" style=\" \"><small><img alt=\"Review commenting in MS Word\" class=\"img-responsive center-block\" src=\"/static/media/images/anshul/2015/04/06/annotation_1_2.png\" style=\" \"/><a href=\"https://islemaster.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/annotation_011.png\" target=\"_blank\">(Image Credits)</a></small></p>\n\n<p id=\"5\" style=\" \">Also, we noticed problems with hovering in the <a href=\"/C/course/computer-science/django/annotation-tutorial-speech-bubbles/12/\" target=\"_blank\">previous post</a> of this tutorial. We'd want to rid our layout of that too. Here is how I propose to do it initially. We wrap each content block and its respective annotations with a <code>div </code> identified by the class name <code>annotation--container </code>, and let its direct descendants float to the left. On small screens, this will cause them to stack on top of each other (or better, we will add a media query to make them relatively positioned block elements).</p>\n\n<p id=\"6\" style=\" \">Let's try it. The markup is transformed to:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"brush: html\">&lt;div data-section=\"1\" class=\"annotation--container clearfix\"&gt;\n&lt;p id=\"1\"&gt;So, here is how we answered them:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"comments clearfix\"&gt;\n&lt;h3 class=\"comments--toggle rectangular-speech has-annotations\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;15&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"comments-container\"&gt;\n&lt;span class=\"comments-container--text\"&gt;Lorem Ipsum &lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;span class=\"comments-container--text\"&gt;Your documentation source should be written as regular Markdown files, \nand placed in a directory somewhere in your project. \nNormally this directory will be named docs and will exist at the top level of your project, \nalongside the mkdocs.yml configuration file. &lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n</pre>\n\n<p id=\"7\" style=\" \">We've wrapped our content blocks (&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; in our case) within &lt;div&gt; elements with class name as \" <code>annotation--container </code>\". The naming scheme is pretty messed up currently, don't worry, we'll sort it out as we go and restore order in our markup. For starters, we are dabbling with the <a href=\"https://en.bem.info/method/\" target=\"_blank\">B.E.M. scheme</a>. For javascript's sake, we'll add a data-section attribute. To ensure that the blocks side up on large screens and stack on smaller ones, we've used the media query as follows:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"brush: sass\">.annotation--container{\nposition: relative;\nwidth: 100%;\n&amp;&gt;*{\nposition: relative;\ndisplay: block;\n@media(min-width: $screen-md){\noverflow: visible;\n}\n}\n</pre>\n\n<p id=\"8\" style=\" \">For large screens, we would want the speech bubble on the top left corner of our annotations, while for mobile screens, somewhere at the right top:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"brush: sass\">.comments--toggle{\ndisplay:none;\nposition: absolute;\nright: 0px;\ntop: -50%;\n@media(min-width: $screen-md){\ntop: 0;\nleft: 0;\nright: auto;\n}\n</pre>\n\n<p id=\"9\" style=\" \">Okay, by default, only the annotations symbol must be visible, and that doesn't require too much space. Rest of the annotation block will become visible only if someone clicks on that annotation button. This will become more evident in the next tutorial when we actually add that interactivity to the page. Currently, we just want to see how it will look on smaller and larger screens when the annotations have been rolled out.</p>\n\n<p id=\"10\" style=\" \">So, we add the following stylesheets:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"brush: sass\">.comments-container{\npadding: 0;\npadding-left: 10%;\nposition: relative;\n/* On larger screens, their widths are smaller, constrained*/\n@media(min-width: $screen-md){\nwidth: 30rem;\npadding: 20px 0 0 40px;\n}\ncolor: lighten($text-color, 40%);\n}\n</pre>\n\n<p id=\"11\" style=\" \">This means that on a larger screen, the annotations will be constrained to a <var>30rem </var> width (on the right side of the text), while for small screens, where they appear under the paragraph, they'll take up the complete width of the container except for the left sided space of <var>10% </var> (to distinguish them from regular content).</p>\n\n<p id=\"12\" style=\" \">Here, we also need to consider the resolutions in between the large and the small. For medium sized desktop screens, if the above settings are in place, then there would be a horizontal scroll <em>and</em> a lot of empty space on the left side of the article block. Now that wouldn't be nice, would it? So, we would like the content to shift leftwards to make space for annotations when user wants to make annotations by clicking on the annotations button. We presume that the user doesn't want to read <em>and</em> make annotations simultaneously. So, we add the following to our overall annotations-container:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"brush: sass\">@media(min-width: $screen-md) and (max-width: $screen-lg){\ntransform: translate(-25rem,0);\ntransition: all 1s;        \n}\n</pre>\n\n<p id=\"13\" style=\" \">In the last leg of this iteration, lets look at the annotations too. They are indistinguishable from regular content. And because they are spans, they aren't stacking. So, let us correct that.</p>\n\n<pre class=\"brush: sass\">.comments-container--text{\ndisplay: block;\nposition: relative;\npadding-top: 20px;\nfont-size: 1.2rem;\n&amp;:first-child{\npadding-top: 5px;\n}\n}\n</pre>\n\n<p id=\"14\" style=\" \">Except for the first annotation, we would like each annotation to leave a top padding of <var>20px </var>, to separate it from its previous annotation. We could have added a bottom margin instead too, and not cared to add the <code>:first-child </code> selector, but then, chances are, we would have needed the <code>:last-child </code> selector to remove the margin from the last element.</p>\n\n<p id=\"15\" style=\" \">How does it look now? I think it looks fine. However, new problems have cropped up. First, the ones with annotations unhidden do not show the hover effects. Second, some annotation symbols still don't persist on hovering around.</p>\n\n<p id=\"16\" style=\" \">We can try altering the <code>z-index </code> of annotations box, but that will cause more pain by making the little squiggles appear above the annotation box. The problem is because we didn't read quite properly how z-indexes are supposed to behave. Here\u2019s an excerpt from <a href=\"http://philipwalton.com/articles/what-no-one-told-you-about-z-index\" target=\"_blank\">Philip Watson's blog</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote><i>New stacking contexts can be formed on an element in one of three ways:<br/>\n* When an element is the root element of a document (the &lt;html&gt; element)<br/>\n* When an element has a position value other than static and a z-index value other than auto<br/>\n* When an element has an opacity value less than 1</i></blockquote>\n\n<p id=\"17\" style=\" \">Long story short, stacking context is akin to co-ordinate systems, but instead of telling where the object is going to lie in 2D space, it determines their relative positioning in the third dimension (the one with planes projecting out of the screen towards the user). Where were we guilty? The third clause, the gradient property makes the objects have varying opacity, and was the culprit. So, if you can do with no gradients (I know I can), then just removing the gradients will solve the problem. Now they change colors.</p>\n\n<p id=\"18\" style=\" \">The other one is more or less liveable with, for now. Let us tackle it in our next section where we add interactivity to them along with responsiveness. Meanwhile, the completed pen is shown below.</p>\n\n<div class=\"center-block\">\n<p class=\"codepen\" data-default-tab=\"result\" data-height=\"257\" data-slug-hash=\"jEomEV\" data-theme-id=\"13781\" data-user=\"anshulthakur\" style=\" \">See the Pen <a href=\"http://codepen.io/anshulthakur/pen/jEomEV/\">Annotations (Rolled out state)</a> by Anshul Thakur (<a href=\"http://codepen.io/anshulthakur\">@anshulthakur</a>) on <a href=\"http://codepen.io\">CodePen</a>.</p>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"//assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js\">\n  </script></div>\n", "pid_count": " 18"}


Converting Annotations Tutorial: Speech bubbles
{"Body": " <p class=\"text-muted\" id=\"1\" style=\" \">In this tutorial on per-paragraph commenting, we will design the collapsed annotations view. We will design and evaluate three different types of speech bubbles using only CSS3 techniques and see which one suits our requirements best.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n<p id=\"2\" style=\" \">In the <a href=\"/C/course/computer-science/django/annotations-tutorial-part-2-basic-layout/11/\" target=\"_blank\">previous tutorial</a>, we created the foundations of our page on which annotations app is going to work. We have some part of our markup ready and would be taking over where the last tutorial left off. Now, we'd want to add more markup - the annotations! But before we went ahead and added them up, we'd like to see how they would look when folded. I imagine there should be some little comment bubble on the margin where we want to show that an annotation has been made, or can be made.</p>\n\n<p class=\"text-center\" id=\"3\" style=\" \"><img alt=\"Different types of speech bubbles\" class=\"img-responsive center-block\" src=\"/static/media/images/anshul/2015/04/05/annotation_3_1.png\" style=\" \"/><small><a href=\"http://www.swishzone.com/manuals/max2components/callout_types.png\" target=\"_blank\">(Image Credits)</a></small></p>\n\n<p id=\"4\" style=\" \">Reading from left to right, we'd most likely encounter it on the right hand side. Further, we choose a paragraph as our quanta of commenting, that is, these annotation bubbles will be found in a position relative to the paragraph, not linewise. This is mainly because a &lt;p&gt; is our textual block. Too many spans are causes of severe headaches and a messy soup.</p>\n\n<p id=\"5\" style=\" \">So, we'll place these comment blocks to the right of our article, and will hang them near the top-right edge. Why? Why top? Why not bottom? Well, we can. Okay, chuck it, we will put it in the bottom edge, but on the right side, for now.</p>\n\n<p id=\"6\" style=\" \">That should be simple. We will:</p>\n\n<ul id=\"7\">\n\t<li>add another block element,</li>\n\t<li>make it relatively positioned,</li>\n\t<li>and float the bubble to its right, or probably, fix it to the right.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Now, how do we make a bubble?</h3>\n\n<p id=\"8\" style=\" \">We would want two states in the bubble:</p>\n\n<ol id=\"9\">\n\t<li>When no annotations have been made, it'd show a '+' sign, which means, add a comment.</li>\n\t<li>When we have some public annotations, it would show the number of annotations on that content block.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p id=\"10\" style=\" \">Hmm, so, does a circular bubble fit the bill? It has to be large enough to house numbers, but small enough not to be a thorn in the eyes of the readers. We could make each kind of bubble and see which one looks better.</p>\n\n<p id=\"11\" style=\" \">So, lets create:</p>\n\n<ol id=\"12\">\n\t<li>An oval bubble</li>\n\t<li>A rectangular bubble</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p id=\"13\" style=\" \">We'll use this simple CSS3 construction by <a href=\"http://nicolasgallagher.com/pure-css-speech-bubbles/demo\" target=\"_blank\">Nicolas Gallagher</a> for these speech bubbles as inspiration.</p>\n\n<p id=\"14\" style=\" \">First, lets make the central oval part:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"brush: sass\">.oval-speech {\nposition:relative;\nmin-width: 25px;\nmin-height: 20px;\nwidth:auto;\npadding: 0;\nmargin: 0;\ntext-align:center;\ncolor:#fff;\nbackground:#5a8f00;\n/* css3 */\n@include background-gradient(#b8db29, #5a8f00);\n@include border-radius(100%, 100%);\n}\n</pre>\n\n<p id=\"15\" style=\" \">Where, our background-gradient mixin looks like:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"brush: sass\">@mixin background-gradient($start-color: #555, $end-color: #333, $start-percent: 0%, $end-percent: 100%){\nbackground:-webkit-gradient(linear, 0 $start-percent , 0 $end-percent, from( $start-color ), to( $end-color ));\nbackground:-moz-linear-gradient($start-color, $end-color);\nbackground:-o-linear-gradient($start-color, $end-color);\nbackground:linear-gradient($start-color, $end-color);\nbackground-repeat: repeat-x;\nfilter: progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.gradient(startColorstr='#{ie-hex-str($start-color)}', endColorstr='#{ie-hex-str($end-color)}', GradientType=1); // IE9 and down\n}\n</pre>\n\n<p id=\"16\" style=\" \">and border-radius like:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"brush: sass\">@mixin border-radius($x-radius: 0px, $y-radius: 0px ) {\n-webkit-border-top-left-radius:$x-radius $y-radius;\n-webkit-border-top-right-radius:$x-radius $y-radius;\n-webkit-border-bottom-right-radius:$x-radius $y-radius;\n-webkit-border-bottom-left-radius:$x-radius $y-radius;\n//Escape \n-moz-border-radius:#{$x-radius}/#{$y-radius};\n-ms-border-radius:#{$x-radius}/#{$y-radius};\nborder-radius:#{$x-radius}/#{$y-radius};\n}\n</pre>\n\n<p id=\"17\" style=\" \">The curvature of the edges into the form of an oval is achieved by the border radius property, which we've set to 100% in x and 100% in the y direction. Now, because the width of the elements is usually going to be larger than their heights, it is unlikely that the shape will resemble a circle, or worse, a standing oval (with width smaller than height). For the just in case scenario, we've put a minimum limit on the width and height.</p>\n\n<blockquote>HTML and CSS rendering is done like a painter's canvas model. What comes before is like a layer of colour, and the one that comes after it is another layer drawn on the previous one.</blockquote>\n\n<p id=\"18\" style=\" \">Now comes the extended part of the speech bubble which is the actual fun part. Drawing the elephant is relatively easy, but it is quite hard to draw its tail. We will use pseudoselectors to achieve that. To do so, we need to realize that HTML and CSS rendering is done like a painter's canvas model. What comes before is like one layer of colour, and the one that comes after it is another layer drawn on top of the previous one. So, if the previous one was <i>painted</i> blue, and the new one is yellow, the overlapping parts would look green.</p>\n\n<p id=\"19\" style=\" \">Second, what are we going to do with pseudo selectors? We know that we can curve the borders of a content block or DOM object. Also, <a href=\"http://www.sitepoint.com/pure-css3-speech-bubbles/\" target=\"_blank\">this article </a> visually explains how the borer comprises of 4 regions which can together be used to create some shapes.</p>\n\n<p id=\"20\" style=\" \">Things can get tricky on the small hairline shape, so we'll first make bigger ones, to see this pseudoselector method in action. I suggest that you try this out as we go on, you could play with it in the codepen shown below.</p>\n\n<div class=\"center-block\">\n<p class=\"codepen\" data-default-tab=\"result\" data-height=\"257\" data-slug-hash=\"WbBQJY\" data-theme-id=\"13781\" data-user=\"anshulthakur\" style=\" \">See the Pen <a href=\"http://codepen.io/anshulthakur/pen/WbBQJY/\">WbBQJY</a> by Anshul Thakur (<a href=\"http://codepen.io/anshulthakur\">@anshulthakur</a>) on <a href=\"http://codepen.io\">CodePen</a>.</p>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"//assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js\">\n  </script></div>\n\n<pre class=\"brush: html\">&lt;div class=\"solid-block\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n</pre>\n\n<pre class=\"brush: sass\">.solid-block{\nheight: 0px;\nwidth: 0px;\nposition: relative;\nmargin-bottom: 100px;\n}\n</pre>\n\n<p id=\"21\" style=\" \">No content, an empty block, but magic happens outside it. Add some SASS within <code>.solid-block </code>:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"brush: sass\">&amp;:before{\ncontent:\"\";\nposition: absolute;\nbottom: -60px;\nright:0;\nborder: 60px solid black;\nborder-top: 0px solid transparent;\nborder-left: 0px solid transparent;\n}\n&amp;:after{\ncontent:\"\";\nposition: absolute;\nbottom: -60px;\nright:0;\nborder: 60px solid gray;\nborder-top: 0px solid transparent;\nborder-left: 0px solid transparent;\ntransform: translate(-50%,0%);\n}\n</pre>\n\n<p id=\"22\" style=\" \">The '&amp;' sign is an alias for the current container. In our case, <code>&amp; </code> will be replaced by <code>solid-block </code>. Compile the sass. (Or as I like it, I've put my files on watch and sass automatically compiles them on detecting any change).</p>\n\n<p id=\"23\" style=\" \">What do we have? Two 60 pixel high blocks of gray and black colours huddled together where we had nothing moments before.</p>\n\n<p id=\"24\" style=\" \">The <code>:before </code> pseudo selector created a block with no content ( <code>content:\"\" </code>) but with a right and bottom border of <var>60px </var> width and black color. Now, since there is no content, this would get us a box of black color <i>below</i> the line with its width as <var>60px </var> in both right side, and in the bottom. When I say width, it is the x-axis width for the right sided border, and y-axis width in the bottom border, so don't get confused that the bottom looks longer. The <code>:after </code> pseudo selector created a similar block, and because of the transform property, it has been moved <var>50% </var> of its initial position towards the negative x-axis, thus revealing some part of the underlying black block.</p>\n\n<p id=\"25\" style=\" \">Now, we want it to curve. So, let's add some border radius to the <code>:before </code> property:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"brush: sass\">border-bottom-right-radius: 100% 100%;\n</pre>\n\n<p id=\"26\" style=\" \">Reloading the page (or if you are working on the codepen, it would autorefresh) shows that the lower edge of the black block has curved. Now, lets curve the gray block too, by adding the following to <code>:after </code> property:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"brush: sass\">border-bottom-right-radius: 100% 100%;\n</pre>\n\n<p id=\"27\" style=\" \">Alright, if we can just make the gray portion disappear along with whatever it was masking, the section that remains would look like the squiggle under the speech bubble. But it isn't pointed. Hmm, I don't quite get it! I have carefully slid the gray box over the black one and both are exactly identical, then there must be a pointed tip on the lower end. As a workaround, let's increase the <code>y-radius </code> of the gray block.</p>\n\n<pre class=\"brush: sass\">border-bottom-right-radius: 100% 150%;\n</pre>\n\n<p id=\"28\" style=\" \">That does it. There we have, a tiny squiggle which can be place below our chat bubble. Thus, our speech bubble stylesheet will now look like:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"brush: sass\">.oval-speech {\nposition:relative;\nmin-width: 25px;\nmin-height: 20px;\nwidth:auto;\npadding: 0;\nmargin: 0;\ntext-align:center;\ncolor:#fff;\nbackground:#5a8f00;\n/* css3 */\n@include background-gradient(#b8db29, #5a8f00);\n@include border-radius(100%, 100%);\np {\nfont-size:0.7em;\nmargin:0;\npadding:0 5px;  \n}\n/* creates part of the curve */\n&amp;:before {\ncontent:\"\";\nposition:absolute;\nz-index:-1;\nbottom:-10px;\nright:50%;\nbackground:#5a8f00; /* need this for webkit - bug in handling of border-radius */\nborder: 10px solid #5a8f00;\nborder-top: 0px solid transparent;\nborder-left: 0px solid transparent;\n/* css3 */\n@include border-bottom-right-radius(100%,100%);\n/* using translate to avoid undesired appearance in CSS2.1-capabable but CSS3-incapable browsers */\n@include transform-translate(0, -2px);\n}\n/* creates part of the curved pointy bit */\n&amp;:after {\ncontent:\"\";\nposition:absolute;\nz-index:-1;\nbottom:-10px;\nright:50%;\nbackground:#fff;\nborder: 10px solid white;\nborder-top: 0px solid transparent;\nborder-left: 0px solid transparent;\n/* css3 */\n@include border-bottom-right-radius(100%,150%);\n/* using translate to avoid undesired appearance in CSS2.1-capabable but CSS3-incapable browsers */\n@include transform-translate(-50%, -2px);\n}\n}\n</pre>\n\n<p id=\"29\" style=\" \">I'm sure you could make the remaining mixins in a fashion I made for border-radius. Try filling in large values like ' <var>154 </var>', or something and notice how the bubble grows proportionately. The complete pen can be seen <a href=\"http://codepen.io/anshulthakur/pen/yyWYow\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p id=\"30\" style=\" \">There is one caveat in this technique. Note that we set the color of the <code>:after </code> element to white; well, if the background color isn't white, it will hurt like a sore thumb sticking out of wet socks. That is where I like SASS. We can set a variable for <code>background-color </code>, and then the change would have to be made only to the variable, and everywhere it was used, the values will be reflected.</p>\n\n<p id=\"31\" style=\" \">Now, let us have a look at the rectangular bubble too, before we can make our mind on which one to use.</p>\n\n<p id=\"32\" style=\" \">Just changing the radius of the main bubble makes it rectangular, but then, the squiggle doesn't look too good, does it? Lets try a plain triangle.</p>\n\n<pre class=\"brush: sass\">.rectangular-speech{\nposition:relative;\nmin-width: 25px;\nmin-height: 20px;\nwidth:auto;\npadding: 0;\nmargin: 0;\ntext-align:center;\ncolor:#fff;\nbackground:#5a8f00;\n/* css3 */\n@include background-gradient(#b8db29, #5a8f00);\n@include border-radius(15%, 15%);\np {\nfont-size:0.5em;\nmargin:0;\npadding:0 3px;  \n}\n/* creates part of the curve */\n&amp;:before {\ncontent:\"\";\nposition:absolute;\nz-index:-1;\nbottom:-10px;\nright:30%;\nborder: 10px solid #5a8f00;\nborder-right: 10px solid transparent;\nborder-bottom: 10px solid transparent;\n/* css3 */\n/* using translate to avoid undesired appearance in CSS2.1-capabable but CSS3-incapable browsers */\n@include transform-translate(0, -2px);\n}\n}\n</pre>\n\n<p id=\"33\" style=\" \">Now, that we have both, which one looks better? I asked my buddy sitting next to me and he said the rectangular one. I had liked the rectangular one the moment I had seen one, my mind did a double somersault. So, by a vote of 2-0, we have a winner! But, should you want the other one, you know, it is just a class-name change away.</p>\n\n<p id=\"34\" style=\" \">Okay, in the last leg of this tutorial, let us make them less obtrusive. Currently, they look too bright to be not-noticed even if we don't want to see them. So, here's a new constraint on them. If no annotations have been made thus far on an object, the bubble must not be visible. Also, the bubble with ' <var>+ </var>' sign must be visible slightly only when we hover on the respective content block. If there have been annotations, they will only be slightly visible and only when we hover on them will they get full color.</p>\n\n<p id=\"35\" style=\" \">Sounds right? Let's begin.</p>\n\n<p id=\"36\" style=\" \">First, hide all of them. We will introduce another CSS class name rather than modifying each and every speech shape; by doing this, we ensure that all speech bubbles get that effect, regardless of their shape. Let's call it <code>speech </code>.</p>\n\n<pre class=\"brush: sass\">.speech{\ndisplay: none;\n}\n</pre>\n\n<p id=\"37\" style=\" \">Reload the page, and all bubbles are now gone!</p>\n\n<p id=\"38\" style=\" \">Now, we want to show only those which DO NOT have a ' <var>+ </var>' as content. Now, we have a problem there. There was a <code>contains() </code> property suggested, but did not make it into the CSS3 specs. So, we need more manipulation. We can:</p>\n\n<ol id=\"39\">\n\t<li>Put a specific class to flag that we have annotations or to mark its absense.</li>\n\t<li>Or we could add a data-xxx attribute.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p id=\"40\" style=\" \">For simplicity sake, we'll do the first. We'll make the blocks with annotations with ' <code>has-annotations </code>' class. With this, we can do away with the ' <code>speech </code>' class too. If it has comments, i.e. ' <code>has-comments </code>' class, we'll hide it.</p>\n\n<pre class=\"brush: sass\">&amp;.has-annotations{\ndisplay:none;\n}\n</pre>\n\n<p id=\"41\" style=\" \">This hides what we wanted to hide. Now, lets change the behaviour of hovering on the ' <var>+ </var>' element. Also, we don't want all of them to look so bright at the outset, but only on hover. So, we can change the default background color to something light. Also, we were setting its background-gradient, so we need to remove that too.</p>\n\n<pre class=\"brush: sass\">background-color: rgba(228, 226, 226, 0.8);\n@include background-gradient(#dcdada, #dcdada);\n</pre>\n\n<p id=\"42\" style=\" \">But wait! The squiggle looks bad. What we want is, we set the color only once and it applies to all of them, right? Right! The squiggles are essentially borders, and we haven't specified the border colors of our parent element (into which the <code>:before </code> and <code>:after </code> will be added to). So, what we can do is, set its color property to the value we set in background-color, and let its descendants inherit that.</p>\n\n<pre class=\"brush: sass\">border-color: rgba(228, 226, 226, 0.8);\n</pre>\n\n<p id=\"43\" style=\" \">Now, it looks fine. So far so good. Now, we want that whenever we hover on top of it, it becomes green. That is done with the <code>:hover </code> property.</p>\n\n<pre class=\"brush: sass\">&amp;:hover{\nbackground-color: rgba(184, 219, 41, 0.8);\n@include background-gradient(#b8db29, #5a8f00);\nborder-color: rgba(110, 131, 24, 0.8);\n}\n</pre>\n\n<p id=\"44\" style=\" \">Looking nice? Sort of. Okay, so, one more thing is left. The ones with annotation count must be visible, and the ones without mustn't, until we hover on top of the content block. So, we need to invert our logic. The has-annotations class is by default, visible, and the one without isn't. That is easy enough for you to do, just set <code>display:block </code> for <code>.has-annotations </code> and <code>none </code> in the default block.</p>\n\n<p id=\"45\" style=\" \">One last effect is to display the ' <var>+ </var>' (add annotation) block when we hover on its parent content object. Currently, there is no simple way to just tell who the preceding element was. Instead, what we can do is to set the chain rule on every content block that is capable of having annotations. If you notice in the markup, the ones which can have annotations have some properties: first, they belong to a parent with ID 'commentable-container', and second, they themselves have a unique ID. So, we can make a rule that the immediate sibling of any content block which is a child of <code>#commentable-container </code> must become visible when we hover on the block.</p>\n\n<pre class=\"brush: sass\">#commentable-container{\n&amp; *[id]:hover + .comments &gt; .comments--toggle, \n&amp; *[id] + .comments:hover &gt; .comments--toggle {\ndisplay: block;\n}\n}\n</pre>\n\n<p id=\"46\" style=\" \">The completed page looks like the pen below</p>\n\n<div class=\"center-block\">\n<p class=\"codepen\" data-default-tab=\"result\" data-height=\"257\" data-slug-hash=\"yyWYow\" data-theme-id=\"13781\" data-user=\"anshulthakur\" style=\" \">See the Pen <a href=\"http://codepen.io/anshulthakur/pen/yyWYow/\">yyWYow</a> by Anshul Thakur (<a href=\"http://codepen.io/anshulthakur\">@anshulthakur</a>) on <a href=\"http://codepen.io\">CodePen</a>.</p>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"//assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js\">\n  </script></div>\n\n<p id=\"47\" style=\" \">This has two immediate issues, one, the hovered element disappears as soon as we hover out. This means we cannot click on it, for the moment we move towards it and hover out of the content block, it disappears (except when we directly transition into it from the top).</p>\n\n<p id=\"48\" style=\" \">Second, on a mobile screen with touch, there is no hover effect, well, because we don't have a mouse there. For now, the invisibility and hover effects will have to go. So, we have to think of something simpler than this hokey-pokey. But that we'll do in the next segment.</p>\n\n<p id=\"49\" style=\" \">This completes our second pass over the layout. We started with a vertically stacked, no-bling kind of content that would work suitably over small as well as big screens.

No annotations have been made thus far, just a symbol to signify that there are some made already, or can be made.</p>\n", "pid_count": " 49"}


Converting Annotations Tutorial (Part 2): Basic Layout

In this tutorial, we will write the minimal markup of the article on which our annotations will be made. The style sheets are written in SASS which is then converted into CSS, with the emphasis being on application, rather than theory, and of course, over UX Design.\n</p>\n<hr/>\n<p id=\"3\" style=\" \">OK. On to design! We start off from the front end design, trying to create the design as a user would experience it, and we do it with a mobile first design approach. In this approach, we first design for small screens (which must be the simplest) and then progressively add complexity to the layouts\n</p>\n<p class=\"text-center\" id=\"4\" style=\" \"><img alt=\"Mobile first design approach\" class=\"img-responsive center-block\" src=\"/static/media/images/anshul/2015/04/04/annotation_2_1.png\" style=\" \"/><small><a href=\"http://www.internet.ltd.uk/sites/default/files/mobile-first-t.png\">Image Credits</a></small>\n</p>\n<p id=\"5\" style=\" \"><strong>So, what do we want?</strong> We want that little bubbles should be available at the edges of the area where we want to allow such annotations. Because people usually read from left to right (there are a few right-to-left scripts though, we are not catering to them as of now), we\u2019ll put these bubbles on the right margin of our article's area. We\u2019ll refer to that area as <i>\u2018Commentable Container\u2019</i>.

Looks the same in all kinds of screens (Try zooming in and out, or better, try using the device emulator bundled in your browsers). It looks fine except one thing. The text is a bit too spread out for large screens. We don\u2019t want it to look too wide on large screens, but centered, while for small screens, it must occupy the complete width of the screen. <a href=\"http://baymard.com/blog/line-length-readability\" target=\"_blank\"> Research</a> indicates that about 65 to 70 letters is what humans in general are comfortable reading in a line without the line being too short to be abrupt, or too long to render it incomprehensible in a single pass. So, on large screens, we\u2019ll not want more than 65-70 characters.\n</p>\n<p id=\"16\" style=\" \">\n  <mark><em>Note: I\u2019m using SASS for writing my CSS files.

Converting Annotations Tutorial (Part 1): Per-Paragraph Commenting
{"Body": " <p class=\"text-muted\" id=\"1\" style=\" \"><small>In this tutorial series, we walk through the process of creation of our per-paragraph commenting app using Django as our backend, with Javascript and jQuery (ajax) for the front end. In this first tutorial, we discuss various issues and possible solutions of solving this problem of per-paragraph commenting.</small></p>\n\n<p id=\"2\" style=\" \">I like how the comments look like on <a href=\"http://medium.com\" target=\"_blank\">Medium.com</a>. I am a compulsive scribbler when it comes to the corners and margins of hard-copies and <strong>THAT</strong> is something I dearly miss in <i>e</i>-reading, other than the comfort of reading from a book compared to a radiating screen. When I first saw this commenting style on Medium, I liked it right away. That was the time when I had no idea that I\u2019d be doing web development at all (I didn\u2019t know web development).</p>\n\n<p class=\"text-center\" id=\"3\" style=\" \"><img alt=\"Extensive scribbling on margins of a book\" class=\"img-responsive center-block\" src=\"/static/media/images/anshul/2015/04/04/annotations_1_1.jpg\" style=\" \"/> <small><a href=\"https://openreflections.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/annotations.jpg\">Image Credits</a></small></p>\n\n<p id=\"4\" style=\" \">While the efficacy of such <i>\u2018notes\u2019</i> on web articles is a <a href=\"http://www.davidbauer.ch/2013/08/13/annotations-for-articles-are-great-except-when-theyre-not/\" target=\"_blank\">long debated topic</a> with Medium.com Website standing as a colossal corroboration of <i>\u2018it works!\u2019</i>, the arguments blared by horns of the opposing pavillion are just as sound! Notes have their place, but they cannot exactly replace comments. Buuut, they do make the articles personal! For it is totally up to you to comment on one particular paragraph, or a selection of lines, and not on the entire piece. Also, not everyone reads the neatly folded annotations. So, where do they work, and where do they not?</p>\n\n<p id=\"5\" style=\" \">An annotation that is longer than the post itself does not work. For that (if you really intend to do so), we have comments. Plus, if we can control the privacy of annotations, they can really benefit as notes scribbled on a personal book while helping preserve the context of the thought. As a result, I\u2019d want to make one for our project, and now have a working prototype on which you must be reading the post.</p>\n\n<p id=\"6\" style=\" \">I\u2019ll admit that the inspiration is the Medium.com website while the various options of how to go about the problem were evaluated from <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19477494/per-paragraph-commenting-system\" target=\"_blank\">this</a> post on StackOverflow. Then, I found this little project <a href=\"http://aroc.github.io/side-comments-demo/\">\u2018Sidecomments.js\u2019</a> which had a replica of Medium-like commenting system. I tried to use it (since I barely knew JS or jQuery back then) and when it did not work (since it needed Require.js, and perhaps Node.js), I pulled up my sleeves for making one myself in vanilla JS (in a bid to learn JS) and well, for the fun of it.</p>\n\n<p id=\"7\" style=\" \">So, this is what we would like to make:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li id=\"8\">A notes app that allows us to make comments, hereafter referred to as <i>Annotations</i>, on article content, then and there.</li>\n\t<li id=\"9\">Allows the user to tune its privacy, allowing them to make it public, private, visible to self and author, and to a user entered list of friends.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p id=\"10\" style=\" \">There are certain concerns that this evokes:</p>\n\n<ol id=\"11\">\n\t<li>How do we identify what comments were made on what paragraph?</li>\n\t<li>What if that paragraph or content is deleted?</li>\n\t<li>What if the author of the article wants to respond but only let the author of annotation know?</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p id=\"12\" style=\" \">So, here is how we answered them:</p>\n\n<h3>How do we identify what comments were made on what paragraph?</h3>\n\n<p id=\"13\" style=\" \">We developed an engine in our content app, which assigns unique IDs to each content type on which annotations can be created by the user before it is saved to the database. For every article, these IDs usually start from 1. The obvious limitation being that the we cannot have annotations on a page where more than one content entry is being displayed. I think that is okay, for annotations on blurb listing pages would be absurd for me. Anytime the content gets updated, the previous IDs remain intact (unless the content is deleted, of course). Even in the event of content deletion, the ID is never reused (it is a linear list which constantly increments). The annotations are saved with keys to their article and its paragraph ID.</p>\n\n<h3>What if that paragraph or content is deleted?</h3>\n\n<p id=\"14\" style=\" \">The answer lies not in how we save annotations, but in how we display it. Annotations are displayed in two places on a page. One is where they belong, on the margins of the text. Next, they are also collected down in a separate tab adjacent to the comments tab. If there are some orphaned annotations, you can find them in this annotation bucket. Plus, if you want to treat them as regular comments, so be it, they are here, at the bottom of the page.</p>\n\n<h3>What if the author of the article wants to respond but only let the author of annotation know?</h3>\n\n<p id=\"15\" style=\" \">Since we\u2019ve already proposed that we\u2019d want to maximize tunability of privacy in our projects, scalability of such flexibility is paramount. But we have to make tradeoffs to make something work, and since we value your privacy more than anything, we\u2019ve found our answer in dealing with this problem outside the context of annotations. But to understand the rationale of our solution, you\u2019ll have to understand what annotations mean to us.</p>\n\n<blockquote><em>Annotations are personal interjections, or ponderings that happen while reading an article.</em></blockquote>\n\n<p id=\"16\" style=\" \">Annotations are personal interjections, or ponderings that happen while reading an article. They are not exactly debatable, but can be a short feedback of sorts to authors, something said by a person to a person, and not broadcasted to everyone. You could think of them as review comments before they are published, the usual reviewing stuff that goes around while content writing. The problem here is, not one, but many people will make such annotations.</p>\n\n<p id=\"17\" style=\" \">Thus, annotations that are aimed at starting conversations must result in conversations. However, they mustn\u2019t do so on the post, but in the privacy of message boxes. Say, a person made a public annotation on an article, and somebody wanted to respond to it. He can respond to it via a message. This is possible rather easily because the other person too is a member (since annotations are for signed up users only). This can lead to great friendships and establishing novel social study circles while keeping the article relatively clean of the informal chatter that might then take place. The concept of group messaging shall allow more people to join in the conversation should the two (original people in conversation) oblige unanimously. Unanimous voting in favor is required because even one person who does not oblige will be offended, and if that is so, we have a problem.</p>\n\n<p id=\"18\" style=\" \"><i>[Also know that all of these are pipelined. So, Friendship circles, as of now does not exist on our portal (we\u2019re on our way though!). Thus, you could think of this requirement as a part of a bigger charter, and only the relevant parts would be implemented for now. But rest assured, as and when the segments are added to the portal, the tutorials will also be updated.]</i></p>\n", "pid_count": " 18"}


Converting 5 maxims for a programmer to live by

Converting What should a 'System' be to a layman?
{"content": "<p style=\"text-align:center\"><span style=\"color:#000000\"><img alt=\"Universe, unblemished and raw\" src=\"/static/media/images/2014/06/04/system1001.jpg\" style=\"height:375px; width:640px\" /></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\">Human beings have an obsession with organising things. Most of us, whether we realise it or not are doing this in our everyday lives. As followers of science (that is why you are here, right?), we believe that everything is covered by a few set of laws and we have reason, and proof to believe so. Often, it is seen as the ultimate objective of science to find that single law which could explain everything. Since the universe is too large to be analysed by a single person or all at the same time, we have so far not been able to produce a convincing unified theory. But we have smaller partial theories which explain a set of things taken from the universe.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><span style=\"color:#000000\"><img alt=\"Universe divided into smaller compartments\" src=\"/static/media/images/2014/06/04/system2001.jpg\" style=\"height:375px; width:640px\" /></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\">In effect, we are surrounding the phenomena with a box which confines or restricts what is allowed inside the box and what are the rules that govern everything that happens inside the box. The idea is that if we can have small boxes assembled together and the iteratively surround combination of boxes with a bigger box we can eventually arrive at that box which includes everything.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\">These boxes are units that perform something. These boxes thus take inputs, act on them and produce an effect or an output. Such individual boxes or a combination of these boxes which eventually make a bigger box called a system. When we apply such models of boxes to thinking we call them schools of thought, when we apply them in explaining how the physical world works we call them a theory, when we express them as mathematical functions call them a model. But in a sense all of them are systems which have an underlying order.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><span style=\"color:#000000\"><img alt=\"Smaller, manageable chunks we shall call systems\" src=\"/static/media/images/2014/06/04/system3001.jpg\" style=\"height:375px; width:640px\" /></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\">Thus a <strong>system </strong>must have a few characteristics:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p><span style=\"color:#000000\">It <em>must be acted upon by something</em> which we call and <strong>input</strong>.</span></p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p><span style=\"color:#000000\">It <em>must </em>act on that input and <em>do something </em>about it. That what it does is called its <strong>output</strong></span></p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p><span style=\"color:#000000\">It <em>cannot do anything on its own</em>, that is, there should have been an input that set the ball rolling. A system that acts on its own without any input at any given time in the past or present would be an imaginary one, like the perpetual engines which could be hundred percent efficient. A simple example would be that&nbsp;water does not transport itself back to the top of the mountain on its own. There are external influences which bring about this change and we call that entire model or system the <strong>water cycle</strong>. The sun is expending its energy to evaporate the water, the gradient in temperatures and pressures causes the winds to flow which carry along water in the form of clouds. Sun, thus, can be considered as the motor which drives the world.</span></p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p><span style=\"color:#000000\">The system must lend itself to observation and analysis within the confines of the box boundaries reasonable accuracy. This means that it must obey some boundary conditions. Thus, a system cannot do everything. That is why fish cannot climb trees and rats usually drown. This also implies that the system can itself be comprised of smaller system, and two or more systems may together form a larger, grander system. It is much like boxes within boxes within boxes within yada yada yada... until we arrive at the biggest box, beyond which we don&#39;t need to know anything, or on the smaller scale, we reach the smallest possible box.</span></p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><span style=\"color:#000000\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://womaninthrisis.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/boxes-inside-boxes.jpg\" style=\"height:427px; width:640px\" /></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\">The last point, that <strong>the system is consistent within&nbsp;a set of boundary conditions</strong>, in life is the most important feature of the system and sadly is the most ignored point too. This leads to much ambiguity and confusion among learners and incidentally is also the source of most of the trouble in every sphere of life.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\">In programming, we call them the edge conditions as they are the conditions where the system breaks/stops behaving as it should. We have trouble over international borders. Integration teams are the most beleaguered teams. Mathematicians always strive to stay away from singularities, as the entire mathematics tends to break when it arrives at such boundary conditions. Literature is often misunderstood when things are<em> taken out of context</em>, that context acting as a boundary condition for the sentences to become the argument that they were intended to.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\">Boundary conditions are not something to be afraid of, but must be given due regard while we&rsquo;re tackling the problems because their established as the boundaries of our understanding. Thus remember this point that every system has its boundary conditions which must be respected and given due regard we want to understand anything and not get into trouble. It will ease much pain, yours and ours too :-)</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "pid_count": "0"}

Converting Doing C OOP Style: Structure members as Class Attributes
{"content": "<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"font-family:comic sans ms,cursive\">In this post, we are going to discuss a classy technique to assign values to members of a structure in C programming language as if they were some members of a class in some OOP language.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"font-family:comic sans ms,cursive\">You might be knowing that C language does not natively support Object Oriented Programming constructs and that if you are to do programming in an object oriented fashion, you need specialized languages like C++, Python, PHP or Java as the immediate recourse. But, knowing that C++ and Python have been written in C, it cannot be possible that C metamorphosizes into something entirely different when it transitions into C++ or any other High Level Language. If we can do OOP in C++, then there must be some way to do it in C too, though with a lot more effort. Now, I am not a OOPs specialist, infact I don&#39;t understand it very well in implementation due to lack of exposure. I code in C for a living, but somewhere between coding in C and making the code more scalable and modular, I&#39;ve rediscovered the need to have something we now call Objects. I&#39;d tell you the story some other day, today, I just wish to demonstrate how a very close parallel of Object Classes can be developed inside C knowing what we already know and perhaps, a little bit new information. Now remember, it isn&#39;t the final form of <code>class</code> that you might be expecting. C does not support classes natively, (but it can be made to do so through hard, incremental work if the cause is justified). What we&#39;re doing here is the beginning of it, were&#39;re starting to model things what an Object Oriented perspective.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"font-family:comic sans ms,cursive\">The closest parallel to a class from OOP in C is a structure. It is like, classes are structures, with a lot of bling. While I&#39;ll keep the discussion of a more complex class for some other post, I&#39;ll show you three methods in which a structure and its members may be declared. You might be aware of two of them, but the third one is more cool (actually it strikes a middle ground between two methods). Without further ado, lets do it with an example.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"font-family:comic sans ms,cursive\"><img alt=\"Book as Struct\" src=\"http://aestheticblasphemy.com/sites/default/files/field/image/book_structure.gif\" /></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"font-family:comic sans ms,cursive\">Consider the example of representing books as our black box unit of representation. A book has various attributes, or properties which help us identify it without having to look inside, the most generic being:</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"font-family:comic sans ms,cursive\">Title of Book</span></span></li>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"font-family:comic sans ms,cursive\">Author(s)</span></span></li>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"font-family:comic sans ms,cursive\">ISBN</span></span></li>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"font-family:comic sans ms,cursive\">Genre</span></span></li>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"font-family:comic sans ms,cursive\">Publisher</span></span></li>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"font-family:comic sans ms,cursive\">Price</span></span></li>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"font-family:comic sans ms,cursive\">Edition</span></span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"font-family:comic sans ms,cursive\">For the present discussion let us assume there is just one author. First, we represent it as a structure in C.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n<span style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"font-family:comic sans ms,cursive\"><code>typedef struct book_type {\r\n    unsigned char title[255]; \r\n    unsigned char author[255]; \r\n    unsigned long isbn; \r\n    unsigned char genre[255];\r\n    unsigned char publisher[255]; \r\n    unsigned int price_inr; \r\n    unsigned short edition; \r\n} BOOK;</code></span></span></pre>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"font-family:comic sans ms,cursive\">Right now, we&#39;ve just described how a structure will look like, i.e. it is a structure definition. We&#39;ve typedef-ed it to save our hands from typing the excruciatingly long &#39;<code>struct book</code>&#39; by merely writing &#39;<code>BOOK</code>&#39;; Not that it makes a difference here, but the names tend to get long as the complexity of the entire project increases and coding etiquette or guidelines come into force. So, now we can start filling in the data using different methods. Lets start with the &#39;here and now&#39; kind of method.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n<span style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"font-family:comic sans ms,cursive\"><code>BOOK book = {\r\n    &quot;The C Programming Language&quot;, \r\n    &quot;Dennis Ritchie&quot;, \r\n    0131103628, \r\n    &quot;Technical&quot;, \r\n    &quot;Prentice Hall&quot;, \r\n    146, \r\n    2 };</code></span></span></pre>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"font-family:comic sans ms,cursive\">Here, we are telling everything in sequence and in one place. Short and sweet, but we need to keep in mind the exact order of the members and the data type of that member. This is called the&nbsp;<em><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Struct_(C_programming_language)\" target=\"_blank\">C89-style initializers</a>&nbsp;style.&nbsp;</em>But that short and sweet is a bitter pill when the number of structures is large, and so are the number of members in it. Also, data types aren&#39;t the only things that go into a structure. Even functions can (and that, gentlemen and ladies, &nbsp;is how we&#39;ll make a class). So, we&#39;d like a more flexible style. Yep, we have that too; here:</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n<span style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"font-family:comic sans ms,cursive\"><code>BOOK book;\r\nbook.title =&nbsp;&quot;The C Programming Language&quot;;\r\nbook.author =&nbsp;&quot;Dennis Ritchie&quot;;\r\nbook.isbn =&nbsp;&nbsp;0131103628;\r\nbook.genre =&nbsp;&quot;Technical&quot;;\r\nbook.publisher =&nbsp;&quot;Prentice Hall&quot;;\r\nbook.price_inr = 146;\r\nbook.edition = 2;</code></span></span></pre>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"font-family:comic sans ms,cursive\">Much better? I don&#39;t know if it also has a technical name. But did you see how much did we had to type? Compare it with the previous method. So much for flexibility! But then, there is a third method which is the essential take away from this post. Lets see it first and then discuss it later.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n<span style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"font-family:comic sans ms,cursive\"><code>BOOK book = {\r\n    .title = &quot;The C Programming Language&quot;&nbsp;,\r\n    .author = &quot;Dennis Ritchie&quot;&nbsp;,\r\n    .isbn = 0131103628&nbsp;,\r\n    .genre = &quot;Technical&quot;,\r\n    .publisher = &quot;Prentice Hall&quot;&nbsp;,\r\n    .price_inr = 146,\r\n    .edition = 2\r\n    };</code></span></span></pre>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"font-family:comic sans ms,cursive\">This is the middle ground between the previous two approaches. We don&#39;t need to enter anything in a particular order, and at the same time don&#39;t need to write <code>book.xxx</code> prefix to each attribute of the structure. This is more compact when we already know what to assign to each member. This also comes in handy when we are trying to write pointers to functions which can be thought of as methods of a class.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"font-family:comic sans ms,cursive\">Why do I compare this declaration with OOPs, because when we initialize an object, we populate all of its members and methods (in case of an interface), encapsulation being the key driver for such approach here. By extending this structure using unions or structures whose members are structures, we can implement class inheritance and by having pointer to functions, we can have some degree of encapsulation too. But we&#39;ll keep that discussion for some other day.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"font-family:comic sans ms,cursive\">(Image Credits: <a href=\"http://www.re-evolve.net/images/book_structure.gif\">Google</a>)</span></span></p>\r\n", "pid_count": "0"}
